  abstract = {Clustering is a solution for classifying enormous data when there is not any early knowledge about classes. With emerging new concepts like cloud computing and big data and their vast applications in recent years, research works have been increased on unsupervised solutions like clustering algorithms to extract knowledge from this avalanche of data. Clustering time-series data has been used in diverse scientific areas to discover patterns which empower data analysts to extract valuable information from complex and massive datasets. In case of huge datasets, using supervised classification solutions is almost impossible, while clustering can solve this problem using unsupervised approaches. In this research work, the focus is on time-series data, which is one of the popular data types in clustering problems and is broadly used from gene expression data in biology to stock market analysis in finance. This review will expose four main components of time-series clustering and is aimed to represent an updated investigation on the trend of improvements in efficiency, quality and complexity of clustering time-series approaches during the last decade and enlighten new paths for future works.},

While traditional methodologies are robust, they frequently require extensive manual efforts and can prove laborious. With the onset of the digital era, machine learning (ML) introduces a paradigm shift in geotechnical risk assessment. This chapter delves into the confluence of ML and geotechnical engineering, spotlighting its enhanced predictive capabilities regarding soil behaviors, landslides, and structural resilience. Harnessing modern datasets and rich case studies, we offer an exhaustive examination that highlights the transformative role of ML in reshaping geotechnical risk assessment practices. Throughout our exploration of evolution, challenges, and future horizons, this chapter emphasizes the significance of ML in advancing and transforming geotechnical practices.},

  abstract = {We used a global positioning system (GPS), levelling, and Sentinel-1 data to evaluate the stability of the Darbandikhan dam in northeast Iraq after the 2017 Mw 7.3 Sarpol-e Zahab earthquake. GPS and levelling datasets collected in March and November 2017 were used to compute the co-seismic surface displacements of the dam. Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images collected between October 2014 and March 2018 were employed to recover the displacement time series of the dam. The large-magnitude displacement gradient on the dam crest hindered the estimation of the co-seismic displacement using this medium-resolution SAR data. However, Sentinel-1 images are sufficient to examine the stability of the dam displacement before and after the earthquake. The results show that the dam was stable between October 2014 and November 2017, but after the earthquake, Sentinel-1 data shows a continuous subsidence of the dam crest between November 2017 and March 2018. To the best knowledge of the authors, this study is the first that utilises InSAR to investigate the behaviour of a dam after a large earthquake.},

  abstract = {Kythira Island is situated at the western Hellenic Arc, which is a region of very high seismicity and tectonic activity. On 8 January 2006, a large seismic event of Mw = 6.7 occurred close to Kythira, in association with the Hellenic subduction zone. We present an extensive multi-temporal interferometry study of ground displacements in Kythira Island exploiting SAR data of a decade, from 2003 to 2009, and from 2015 to 2019. The line-of-sight displacement field for the 2003--2009 time period presents small-scale displacements that do not exceed -3 mm/y, identified to the East of Kythira's airport, and 3 mm/y in the central part of the island. We exploit then Sentinel-1 data from 2015 to 2019, of both descending and ascending Sentinel-1 SAR imaging modes to decompose the line-of-sight measured deformation to vertical and east--west motion components. Higher vertical displacement rates characterize the central part of the island, with a maximum value of 5 mm/y. This short-term uplift rate exceeds by an order of magnitude the long-term geologic uplift rate of \textasciitilde 0.13 mm/y found in the island during the Quaternary. We discuss possible regional geophysical explanations for this discrepancy. Strike-slip components are detected in the N--E coast of the Potamos village, where horizontal displacements occur, with an east-ward trend and a maximum value of -3 mm/y. These insights are valuable input for the systematic monitoring of this high seismic risk island and the dynamic assessment of its hazard potential.},

  abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers are nowadays commonly used in monitoring applications, e.g., in estimating crustal and infrastructure displacements. This is basically due to the recent improvements in GNSS instruments and methodologies that allow high-precision positioning, 24 h availability and semiautomatic data processing. In this paper, GNSS-estimated displacements on a dam structure have been analyzed and compared with pendulum data. This study has been carried out for the Eleonora D'Arborea (Cantoniera) dam, which is in Sardinia. Time series of pendulum and GNSS over a time span of 2.5 years have been aligned so as to be comparable. Analytical models fitting these time series have been estimated and compared. Those models were able to properly fit pendulum data and GNSS data, with standard deviation of residuals smaller than one millimeter. These encouraging results led to the conclusion that GNSS technique can be profitably applied to dam monitoring allowing a denser description, both in space and time, of the dam displacements than the one based on pendulum observations.},

In the present research we applied time-series of Sentinel-1 satellite images acquired during 2018--2020. All ground deformation derivatives showed the continuous subsidence at the Tengiz oilfield with increasing velocity. 3D and 2D decompositions of LOS measurements to vertical movement showed that the Tengiz Oil Field 2018--2020 continuously subsided with the maximum annual vertical deformation velocity around 70 mm. Based on the LOS measurements, the maximum annual subsiding velocity was observed to be 60 mm. Cosine corrections of LOS measurements to vertical movement, however, revealed a maximum annual vertical deformation velocity of 77 mm. The vertical deformation confirmed typical patterns of subsidence caused by oil extraction. Detected east-west and north-south horizontal movements at the Tengiz field clearly indicated that the study area crossed by seismic faults is affected by natural tectonic processes. The overall RMSE of 3D decomposed vertical deformation in relationship to LOS measurements and cosine corrections were in the range of 10--13 mm and 6--8 mm, correspondingly. The results of the present research will support operators of oil and gas fields and also other types of infrastructure to evaluate the actual differences of InSAR ground deformation measurements against the required standards and the precision of measurements depending on the operational needs, timeframes and availability of radar imagery.},

  abstract = {Hydrostatic-season-time model (HST) are commonly used by engineers to assess dam safety. The model predicts deformations by considering the effects of temperatures in terms of seasonal function, water level fluctuation and time. However, the non-necessity of real temperature measurements and the non-linear relationship between dependent and influencing variables represent a limit. Recently, researchers developed a new one-dimensional analytical model which gives more accurate estimation of thermal field in concrete dams than those obtained through numerical models or the Stucky and Derron method. From that, in this work we tried to improve HST model by correcting the thermal component. Two terms extracted from the analytical model were added to the HST model making it more sensitive to the daily variation of air and water temperatures variations, the first one simulates deformations induced by solar radiation, rainfall and long wave radiation, while the second term assume water temperature effect. The performance of the proposed model was tested using displacements data recorded on six pendulums installed at Tichy Haf arch dam located in north Algeria during five years. The root means square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) indices indicated that the improved model provided better results than the traditional one.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Clustering analysis of sequence data continues to address many applications in engineering design, aided with the rapid growth of machine learning in applied science. This paper presents an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to extract defining characteristics of earthquake ground-motion spectra, also called latent features, to aid in ground-motion selection (GMS). In this context, a latent feature is a low-dimensional machine-discovered spectral characteristic learned through nonlinear relationships of a neural network autoencoder. Machine discovered latent features can be combined with traditionally defined intensity measures and clustering can be performed to select a representative subgroup from a large ground-motion suite. The objective of efficient GMS is to choose characteristic records representative of what the structure will probabilistically experience in its lifetime. Three examples are presented to validate this approach, including the use of synthetic and field recorded ground-motion datasets. The presented deep embedding clustering of ground-motion spectra has three main advantages: (1) defining characteristics that represent the sparse spectral content of ground motions are discovered efficiently through training of the autoencoder, (2) domain knowledge is incorporated into the machine learning framework with conditional variables in the deep embedding scheme, and (3) the method results in a ground-motion subgroup that is more representative of the original ground-motion suite compared to traditional GMS~techniques.},

Recent literature emphasizes the need to focus beyond methodological challenges, and the importance of data centricity, transparency, suitability for practice and geotechnical context --together, the so-called ``data-centric geotechnics''. This review paper offers additional perspective to be contemplated for successful applications of ML in geotechnics: one should explore and discuss (i) the problem to be solved, (ii) the type, quality and quantity of data, and (iii) the methodology/algorithm. The paper further discusses that more strict guidelines and protocols are required for evaluating data and trained ML models if they are to be accepted and successfully integrated into practice. In the transition to data-centric practices, geotechnical engineering, a traditionally data-poor field, has much to learn from fields where decisionmaking based on data has a long and rich history.},

  abstract = {Natural hazards generate disasters and huge losses in several aspects, with landslides being one of the natural risks that have caused great impacts worldwide. The aim of this research was to explore a method based on machine learning to evaluate susceptibility to rotational landslides in an area near Cuenca city, Ecuador, which has a high incidence of these phenomena, mainly due to its environmental conditions, and in which, however, such studies are scarce. The implemented method consisted of an artificial neural network multilayer perceptron (ANN MLP), generated with the neuralnet R package, with which, by means of different backpropagation algorithms (RPROP+, RPROP-, SLR, SAG, and Backprop), five landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) were generated for the study area. A landslide inventory updated to 2019 and 10 conditioning factors, mainly topographical, geological, land cover, and hydrological, were considered. The results obtained, which were validated through the AUC-ROC value and statistical parameters of precision, recall, accuracy, and F-Score, showed a good degree of adjustment and an acceptable predictive capacity. The resulting maps showed that the area has mostly sectors of moderate, high, and very high susceptibility, whose landslide occurrence percentages vary between approximately 63\% and 80\%. In this research, different variants of the backpropagation algorithm were implemented to verify which one gave the best results. With the implementation of additional methodologies and correct zoning, future analyses could be developed, contributing to adequate territorial planning and better disaster risk management in the area.},

  abstract = {Accurate and reliable prediction of dam deformation (DD) is of great significance to the safe and stable operation of dams. In order to deal with the fluctuation characteristics in DD for more accurate prediction results, a new hybrid model based on a decomposition-ensemble model named VMD-SE-ER-PACF-ELM is proposed. First, the time series data are decomposed into subsequences with different frequencies and an error sequence (ER) by variational mode decomposition (VMD), and then the secondary decomposition method is introduced into the prediction of ER. In these two decomposition processes, the sample entropy (SE) method is innovatively utilized to determine the decomposition modulus. Then, the input variables of the subsequences are selected by partial autocorrelation analysis (PACF). Finally, the parameter-optimization-based extreme learning machine (ELM) models are used to predict the subsequences, and the outputs are reconstructed to obtain the final prediction results. The case analysis shows that the VMD-SE-ER-PACF-ELM model has strong prediction ability for DD. The model is then compared with other nonlinear and time series models, and its performance under different prediction periods is also analyzed. The results show that the proposed model is able to adequately describe the original DD. It performs well in both training and testing stages. It is a preferred data-driven model for DD prediction and can provide a priori knowledge for health monitoring of dams.},

Second, from the perspective of the dam lifecycle, the application of AI in exploration, construction and operation and maintenance is reviewed.

The urgent need for the accurate prediction of these geotechnical events is driven by two main goals: advancing our understanding of the underlying geophysical mechanisms and establishing efficient evacuation protocols. Although traditional physics-based models offer in-depth insights, their reliance on numerous assumptions and parameters limits their practical usability. In our study, we constructed an experimental artificial slope and monitored it until failure, generating an in-depth displacement dataset. Leveraging this dataset, we developed and compared prediction models rooted in both statistical and machine learning paradigms. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between generic evaluation metrics and the specific needs of slope failure prediction, we introduced a bespoke performance. Our results indicate that while the statistical approach did not effectively provide early warnings, the machine learning models, when assessed with our bespoke performance metric, showed significant promise as reliable early warning systems. These findings hold potential to fortify disaster prevention measures and prioritize human safety.},

  abstract = {There are many factors affecting dam deformation, and the time series of deformation data is directly modeled without considering the seasonality and periodicity of each influencing factor, the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) is proposed for prediction in this paper. Firstly, the time series of deformation data is decomposed by EEMD, which weakens its volatility to some extent, and decomposes various factors affecting dam deformation, so as to obtain a series of Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) with different frequencies; secondly, according to the seasonal characteristics and periodic characteristics of each IMF, the SARIMA model was established respectively for rolling prediction; thirdly, the final forecast results can be obtained by superimposing the forecast results of each IMF. It is verified by experiments and compared with Gray Model, Kalman Filter Model and SARIMA model that EEMD-SARIMA model has higher prediction accuracy, and it has better fitting degree, which means that it is an effective method for dam deformation prediction.},

  abstract = {Temperature is one of the factors affecting the safety operation of concrete arch dams. To accurately reconstruct the temperature field of the concrete arch dam online based on the temperature data of several typical dam sections, this paper proposes the AdaBoost-ANN algorithm. The algorithm uses artificial neural network (ANN) to establish a training set of the measured temperature data and the temperature field of the concrete arch dam obtained by the three-dimensional finite element model; these trained artificial neural networks are used as weak classifiers of the AdaBoost algorithm. Then, the AdaBoost-ANN algorithm is used to establish the mapping relationship between the measured temperature data and the temperature field, and the online reconstruction of the temperature field of the concrete arch dam is realized. The case study shows that the temperature field of the concrete arch dam can be accurately established by AdaBoost-ANN algorithm based on limited temperature observation data. The algorithm is more time-saving and labor-saving than the finite element method and is convenient for online reconstruction of the temperature field and assessment of the safety status of the concrete arch dam.},

  abstract = {Monitoring surface deformation on dams is commonly carried out by in situ geodetic surveying, which is time consuming and characterized by some limitations in space coverage and frequency. More recently microwave satellite-based technologies, such as advanced-DInSAR (Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry), have allowed the integration and improvement of the observation capabilities of ground-based methods thanks to their effectiveness in collecting displacement measurements on many non-destructive control points, corresponding to radar reflecting targets. The availability of such a large number of points of measurement, which are distributed along the whole structure and are characterized by millimetric accuracy on displacement rates, can be profitably adopted for the calibration of numerical models. These models are implemented to simulate the structural behaviour of a dam under conditions of stress thus improving the ability to maintain safety standards. In this work, after having analysed how advanced DInSAR can effectively enhance the results from traditional monitoring systems that provide comparable accuracy measurements on a limited number of points, an FEM model of the Genzano di Lucania earth dam is developed and calibrated. This work is concentrated on the advanced DInSAR technique referred to as Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approach, benefiting from its capability to generate deformation time series at full spatial resolution and from multi-sensor SAR data, to measure the vertical consolidation displacement of the Genzano di Lucania earth dam.},

When evaluating embankment behavior, the geotechnical instrumentation for pore pressure and vertical and horizontal displacements measurements can be an extremely useful tool, including when there are adjacent structures. This paper presents the results of monitoring and analysis of the performance of embankments on soft soil, carried out by the Geotechnical Group (GEGEP) of the Federal University of Pernambuco. Three Brazilian cases are presented: the Juturna\'iba trial embankment and Juturna\'iba Dam construction, in Rio de Janeiro; and the access embankments of the Jitituba River Bridge, in Alagoas. The analysis of embankment behavior was performed by using the traditional model (undrained condition during construction) and the Tavenas \& Leroueil (1980) model (partially drained condition during construction). The results showed that it is possible to predict embankment behavior. They also showed the complexity of this topic and the importance of monitoring and evaluating each case in accordance with the location and the type of instrument, subsoil and embankment conditions.},

  abstract = {This paper is focused on Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI), the most advanced class of differential interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar techniques (DInSAR). The paper only refers to the PSI techniques that exploit data acquired by spaceborne SAR sensors. PSI is a powerful remote sensing technique used to measure and monitor the temporal evolution of surface deformation phenomena. In this work we consider the C-band applications based on the ERS and Envisat SAR data. It starts with a concise description of the main characteristics of PSI deformation monitoring, and an outline of the main PSI products. An important part of the paper includes the discussion of the major advantages and the key open technical issues of the technique. The open technical issues include the limitations of PSI to spatially and temporally sample the deformation phenomena, the critical limitation related to the deformation rates that can be observed, etc. The last part of the paper discusses some relevant PSI validation results, which represent a key aspect that drives the applicability and acceptability of this relatively new technique. In the last fifteen years the DInSAR techniques have demonstrated their potential as land deformation measurement tools, while in the last few years their capability has been considerably improved by using the PSI techniques. The paper describes the main outcomes of a major PSI validation project funded by the European Space Agency, which was run within the GMES Terrafirma project. The key findings of this validation exercise are summarized in this paper. The project generated rich PSI data sets and interesting global statistics, which concern large sets of measurements and provide information on the global behaviour of the key PSI products: mean deformation velocities, deformation time series, density of the PSI measurement, topographic corrections and geocoding of each measured point, etc.},

Then, a review of the main PSI algorithms proposed in the literature is provided, describing the main approaches and the most important works devoted to single aspects of PSI. A central part of this paper is devoted to the discussion of different characteristics and technical aspects of PSI, e.g. SAR data availability, maximum deformation rates, deformation time series, thermal expansion component of PSI observations, etc. The paper then goes through the most important PSI validation activities, which have provided valuable inputs for the PSI development and its acceptability at scientific, technical and commercial level.

  abstract = {The unique structures and foundations of a dam make its safety monitoring a complex task. As the most intuitive effect of dams, deformation contains important information on dam evolution. Actual response has the purpose of diagnosis and early warning compared with model prediction. Given the poor generalization ability of the conventional statistical model, establishing a dam deformation monitoring model is thus essential. The prediction of concrete dam deformation using statistical model and random forest regression (RFR) model is studied. To build an optimized RFR model, the statistical model is used to establish input variables, select the appropriate parameters Mtry and Ntree according to out-of-bag error, and extract strong explanatory variables. The model's advantage is that the influence factors can describe concrete dam deformation, and RF can serve as a sensible new data mining tool. The importance of variables for deformation prediction is measured by RF. The RFR method can extract representative influencing factors based on variable importance. The methods are applied to an actual concrete dam. Results indicate that the RFR model can be applied for analysis and prediction of other structural behavior.},

  abstract = {Landslides are major geological hazards and frequently occur in mountainous areas with steep slopes, often causing significant loss. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has been widely used in landslide measurement over the last three decades. However, InSAR only can measure one-dimensional displacements (i.e. those in the radar's line of sight (LOS) direction), resulting in the uncertainty between LOS displacement and the real slope displacement. In this paper, based on ascending and descending data from Sentinel-1 satellite, a wide-area potential landslide early identification was carried out using SBAS-InSAR in the whole of Mao County, a mountainous area in western Sichuan (China), with a total of 41 potential landslides successfully detected. Based on the quantitative analysis, the results show that the InSAR LOS measurement values are slope aspect and gradient-dependent. Finally, we innovatively derived a LOS displacement sensitivity map of InSAR in landslide measurement, revealing the relationship between LOS displacement, real displacements on slopes with arbitrary aspects and gradients, and SAR geometric distortion. This is a generalized finding useful for any slopes. It provides theoretical support to acquire and understand the real slope displacement from InSAR landslide measurement, which is vital to assist in correctly interpreting LOS displacement and carrying out subsequent quantitative geological engineering analysis.},

  abstract = {In the absence of systematic structural monitoring to support adequate maintenance standards, many existing infrastructures may reach unacceptable quality levels during their life cycle, resulting in significant damage and even potential failure. The metropolitan area of the Gulf of Salerno (Italy), served by a complex multimodal transport network connecting the port area to the roads and railways surrounding the urban area, represents an important industrial and commercial hub at the local and international scale. This particular scenario, developed in a complex morphological and geological context, has led to the interference and overlapping of the transport network (highway, railway, main and secondary roads) that run through the piedmont area north of the port. Given the relevance of the area, our research aims to highlight the capabilities of the persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) technique, belonging to the group of differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), to extract space--temporal series of displacements on ground points or artifacts with millimeter accuracy useful to understand ongoing deformation processes. By using archived data from the European Space Agency missions, i.e., ERS1/2 (European remote-sensing satellite) and ENVISAT (environmental satellite), and the most recent data from COSMO-SkyMed constellations, it was possible to collect a 28-year dataset that was used to spatially analyze displacement patterns at a site-specific scale to check the stability of viaducts and embankments, and on a larger scale to understand the activity of the surrounding slopes. Despite the different resolution and subsequently the ground density, the analysis of the different datasets showed a spatiotemporal consistency in the displacement patterns that concerned two subareas showing significant annual velocity trends, one northeast of the city and the second in the port area. The analysis presented in this paper highlights how a complex geologic area, combining slope movements and various fault systems, could be a major concern for the stability of the overlying infrastructure and also the role that a PSI analysis can play in remotely monitoring their behavior over long periods of time.},

Statistical analysis tools are widely used to compare the current response of the dam to a whole string of recorded data, in order to highlight in a timely manner eventual unwanted behaviours. The main drawback of this approach is that the structural response quantities are related to the external loads using analytical functions, whose parameters do not have physical meaning. Another option is using the structural identification technique, based on finite element models of the structure, that can be usefully adopted to obtain an estimate of true physical parameters, such as the elastic Young modulus, an overall indicator of structural integrity.},

In particular, we focus our analysis on three periods: a) the time interval following the 2014 flank eruption, b) the July--August 2019 eruption and c) the following post-eruptive phase. To do this, we take advantage from an unprecedented set of space-borne and ground-based SAR data collected from April 2015 up to November 2019 along two (one ascending and one descending) Sentinel-1 (S-1) tracks, as well as, in the same period, by two ground-based systems installed along the Sciara del Fuoco northern rim. Such data availability permitted us to first characterize the volcano long-term 3D deformation behavior of the pre-eruptive period (April 2015--June 2019), by jointly inverting the space-borne and ground-based InSAR measurements. Then, the GB-SAR measurements allowed us to investigate the sin-eruptive time span (3rd July 2019 -- 30th August 2019) which revealed rapid deformation episodes (e.g. more than 30 mm/h just 2 min before the 3rd July 2019 explosion) associated with the eruptive activity, that cannot be detected with the weekly S-1 temporal sampling. Finally, the S-1 measurements permitted to better constrain the post 2019 eruption deformations (31st August 2019 -- 5th November 2019), which are mainly located outside the GB-SAR sensed area. The presented results demonstrate the effectiveness of the joint exploitation of the InSAR measurements obtained through satellite and terrestrial SAR systems, highlighting their strong complementarity to map and interpret the deformation phenomena affecting volcanic areas.},

  abstract = {The development of satellite sensors and interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology has enabled the exploitation of their benefits for long-term structural health monitoring (SHM). However, some restrictions cause this process to provide a small number of images leading to the problem of small data for SAR-based SHM. Conversely, the major challenge of the long-term monitoring of civil structures pertains to variations in their inherent properties by environmental and/or operational variability. This article aims to propose new hybrid unsupervised learning methods for addressing these challenges. The methods in this work contain three main parts: (i) data augmentation by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, (ii) feature normalization, and (iii) decision making via Mahalanobis-squared distance. The first method presented in this work develops an artificial neural network-based feature normalization by proposing an iterative hyperparameter selection of hidden neurons of the network. The second method is a novel unsupervised teacher--student learning by combining an undercomplete deep neural network and an overcomplete single-layer neural network. A small set of long-term displacement samples extracted from a few SAR images of TerraSAR-X is applied to validate the proposed methods. The results show that the methods can effectively deal with the major challenges in the SAR-based SHM applications.},

  abstract = {Dams are complex systems that involve both the structure itself and its foundation. Rheological phenomena, expansive reactions, or alterations in the geotechnical parameters of the foundation, among others, result in non-reversible and cumulative modifications in the dam response, leading to trends in the monitoring data series. The accurate identification and definition of these trends to study their evolution are key aspects of dam safety. This manuscript proposes a methodology to identify trends in dam behavioural data series by identifying the influence of the time variable on the predictions provided by the ML models. Initially, ICE curves and SHAP values are employed to extract temporal dependence, and the ICE curves are found to be more precise and efficient in terms of computational cost. The temporal dependencies found are adjusted using a GWO algorithm to different function characteristics of irreversible processes in dams. The function that provides the best fit is selected as the most plausible. The results obtained allow us to conclude that the proposed methodology is capable of obtaining estimates of the most common trends that affect movements in concrete dams with greater precision than the statistical models most commonly used to predict the behaviour of these types of variables. These results are promising for its general application to other types of dam monitoring data series, given the versatility demonstrated for the unsupervised identification of temporal dependencies.},

A review on the Sustainable Development concept and its goals is presented followed by Earth Observation approaches relevant to this field, giving special attention to the contribution of Machine Learning methods and algorithms as well as their potential and capabilities to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, it is observed that Earth Observation plays a key role in monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals given its cost-effectiveness pertaining to data acquisition on all scales and information richness. Despite the success of Machine Learning upon Earth Observation data analysis, it is observed that performance is heavily dependent on the ability to extract and synthesise characteristics from data. Hence, a deeper and effective analysis of the available data is required to identify the strongest features and, hence, the key factors pertaining to Sustainable Development. Overall, this research provides a deeper understanding on the relation between Sustainable Development, Earth Observation and Machine Learning, and how these can support the Sustainable Development of countries and the means to find their correlations. In pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals, given the relevance and growing amount of data generated through Earth Observation, it is concluded that there is an increased need for new methods and techniques strongly suggesting the use of new Machine Learning techniques.},

However, it is of primary importance to implement automated solutions aimed at performing integrated analysis of large amounts of interferometric data. To effectively detect high-displacement areas and classify ground motion sources, here we explore the feasibility of a machine learning-based approach. This is achieved by applying the random forest (RF) technique to large-scale deformation maps spanning 2015--2018. Focusing on the northern part of Italy, we train the model to identify landslide, subsidence, and mining-related ground motion with which to construct a balanced training dataset. The presence of noisy signals and other sources of deformation is also tackled within the model construction. The proposed approach relies on the use of explanatory variables extracted from the A-DInSAR datasets and from freely accessible informative layers such as Digital Elevation Model (DEM), land cover maps, and geohazard inventories. In general, the model performance is very promising as we achieved an overall accuracy of 0.97, a true positive rate of 0.94 and an F1-Score of 0.93. The obtained outcomes demonstrate that such transferable and automated approach may constitute an asset for stake\- holders in the framework of geohazards risk management.},

In this paper we present an unsupervised and automated approach based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering to detect patterns of natural or anthropogenic ground deformation from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) Time Series. For our proof-of-concept, we focus on the Valle d'Aosta region (Northwest Italy) where mass wasting processes frequently occurs, interacting with human activities and in\- frastructures. The large volumes of Sentinel-1 data produced allows for retrieving horizontal and vertical Time Series from multi-geometry data fusion of Line-of-Sight (LOS) InSAR measurements. The added benefit of combining ascending/descending InSAR data and interpolating displacements in time at different time steps is here explored prior to data dimensionality reduction and feature extraction through PCA. The retrieved principal components serve as a continuous solution for cluster membership indicators in the K-means clustering method, allowing to define spatially and temporally coherent displacement phenomena. The signal of the ground deformation clusters is then deconstructed into the underlying trend and seasonality components to enhance the interpretability of the classified satellite InSAR features. Using InSAR Time series data spanning 2014--2020, the proposed approach detects several slope movements and anthropogenic deformations with both linear and seasonal displacement behaviours. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of our transferable approach to the development of automated ground motion analysis systems.},

  abstract = {Evaluating long-term building reconstruction is essential to strengthen resilience to earthquakes. Field investigations provide detailed and accurate information for building assessments, but are often labour intensive, costly, and time consuming, particularly when considering the regional-scale impact of earthquakes. In contrast, satellite Remote Sensing (RS) techniques provide frequent data across vast areas, making them ideal for regional-scale post-earthquake assessments, which can complement field surveys. Despite this, most RS studies have relied on manual change detection of satellite data before and after the event, limiting their potential for automated assessment and reducing their support for field investigations. In this study, we developed a novel RS method designed to assist field investigations of post-earthquake building reconstruction on a regional scale. The method automatically identifies target buildings for field teams to investigate, locating collapsed structures or buildings that have changed due to post-earthquake reconstruction efforts. We applied Multi-Temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (MT-InSAR) for the first time to evaluate post-earthquake building reconstruction. The proposed method involves a two-stage analysis: first, a grid-level assessment on a regional scale to detect areas with reconstruction activities following an earthquake, and then a detailed building-level analysis to identify individual buildings that have undergone changes as part of the reconstruction process within these areas. The method was used to assess building reconstruction efforts in Nepal after the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. For the MT-InSAR analysis, we acquired two stacks of 3-m-resolution SAR images, one before and one after the earthquake. The grid-level analysis detected multiple urban areas with significant changes, which were then subjected to a building-level analysis. This analysis pinpointed the locations of affected buildings and determined the extent of changes related to reconstruction activities. A comparison of the building-level results with field observations confirmed that the method successfully identified buildings that have undergone changes. These changes included buildings that were left in a collapsed state, demolished, under construction, or fully reconstructed. The MT-InSAR-based approach introduced in this study has the potential to serve as a valuable tool to guide future field surveys related to post-earthquake reconstruction, significantly reducing the time and effort needed for such assessment.},

  abstract = {Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology has been widely applied to measure Earth surface motions related to natural and anthropogenic crustal deformation phenomena. With the widespread uptake of data captured by the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 mission and other recently launched or planned space-borne SAR missions, the usage of the InSAR technique to detect and monitor Earth surface displacements will increase even more in the coming years. However, InSAR can only measure a one-dimensional motion along the radar line of sight (LOS), which makes interpretation and communication of InSAR measurements challenging, and can add ambiguity to the modelling process. Within this paper, we investigate the implications of the InSAR LOS geometry using simulated and observed deformation phenomena and describe a methodology for multi-geometry data fusion of LOS InSAR measurements from many viewing geometries. We find that projecting LOS measurements to the vertical direction using the incidence angle of the satellite sensor (and implicitly assuming no horizontal motions are present) may result in large errors depending on the magnitude of horizontal motion and on the steepness of the incidence angle. We quantify these errors as the maximum expected error from simulated LOS observations based on a Mogi deformation model. However, we recommend to use LOS observations from several image geometries wherever data are available, in order to solve for vertical and E--W oriented horizontal motion. For an anthropogenic deformation phenomenon observed in seven independent InSAR analyses of Envisat SAR data from the Sydney region, Australia, we find that the strong horizontal motion present could lead to misinterpretation of the actual motion direction when projecting LOS measurements to vertical (uplift instead of subsidence). In this example, the difference between multi-geometry data fusion and vertical projection of LOS measurements (at an incidence angle of 33.8\textopenbullet ) reach up to 67\% of the maximum vertical displacement rate. Furthermore, the position of maximum vertical motion is displaced horizontally by several hundred metres when the LOS measurements are projected.},

  abstract = {Landslides are geological disasters that can cause serious severe damage to properties and lead to the loss of human lives. The application of deep learning technology to optical remote sensing images can help in the detection of landslide areas. Traditional landslide detection models usually have complex structural designs to ensure accuracy. However, this complexity leads to slow detection, and these models often do not satisfy the rapid response required for the emergency monitoring of landslides. Therefore, we designed a lightweight landslide target detection network based on a CenterNet and a ResNet50 network. We replaced the BottleNeck in the backbone network of ResNet50 with a Ghost-BottleNeck structure to reduce the number of parameters in the model. We also introduced an attention mechanism module based on channel attention and spatial attention between the adjacent GhostModule modules to rich the landslide features. We introduced a lightweight multiscale fusion method in the decoding process that presented a cross-layer sampling operation for the encoding process based on Feature Pyramid Network. To down-sample from a low resolution to a high resolution and up-sample from a high resolution to a low resolution, thus skipping the medium-resolution levels in the path. We added the feature maps obtained in the previous step to the feature fusion. The Conv module that adjusts the number of channels in the multiscale feature fusion operation was replaced with the GhostModule to achieve lightweight capability. At the end of the network, we introduced a state-of-the-art Yolov5x as a teacher network for feature-based knowledge distillation to further improve the accuracy of our student network. We used challenging datasets including multiple targets and multiscale landslides in the western mountains of Sichuan, China (e.g., Danba, Jiuzhaigou, Wenchuan, and Maoxian) to evaluate the proposed lightweight landslide detection network. The experimental results show that our model satisfied landslide emergency requirements in terms of both accuracy and speed; the parameter size of the proposed lightweight model is 18.7 MB, namely, 14.6\% of the size of the original CenterNet containing the ResNet50 network. The single image detection time is 52 ms---twice as fast as the original model. The detection accuracy is 76.25\%, namely, 12\% higher than that of the original model.},

Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) offers a scalable, non-intrusive alternative to conventional methods, ideal for large-scale and automated monitoring. However, spatial and temporal resampling, commonly used to reconstruct structural displacements from InSAR data, introduces uncertainty into final estimates. This paper presents a framework to quantify and reduce this uncertainty. A case study of a bridge in Rome, Italy, demonstrates that uncertainty metrics can effectively guide improvements in Persistent Scatterer (PS) clustering and grid configuration. Specifically, removing off-bridge PSs from a single grid cell reduced displacement uncertainty by 45 \%, while replacing a fixed grid with a tailored layout for the entire bridge resulted in a 12 \% average reduction in uncertainty. These findings provide valuable guidance for optimising InSAR data processing in SHM and underscore the critical role of PS clustering in improving measurement precision.},

The stack lies directly over estuarine unconsolidated sediments with no protective layer in between. Here, we evaluate for the first time the structural stability of the PG stack, monitoring the deformation suffered by the salt-marsh basement. Through the web-based Geohazard Exploitation Platform (GEP) of the European Space Agency (ESA), a specific differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) algorithm known as Parallel Small Baseline Subset (P-SBAS) has been used to process 279 ESA Sentinel-1 images acquired between October 2016 and June 2021. Resulting displacement maps and time-series curves reveal vertical displacements of up to 16 cm/year. This vertical motion has been associated to subsidence. In parallel with subsidence, horizontal movements {$>$} 2.5 cm/year have been also accounted and linked to talus destabilization. The analysis also demonstrates that the Huelva PG stack is vulnerable to adverse weather condition. The present study demonstrates that the InSAR-based methods are effective tools for monitoring the stability and ground motion of large waste stockpiles.},

In doing so, a brief background, models, func\- tions, and classification of DM techniques are presented. To this end, wide range of researches are collected in order to demonstrate the development of DM techniques, detect the most popular DM techniques, and compare the applicability of existing DM techniques in SHM.

Authored by research engineers specializing in civil engineering and data science, and reviewed by experienced dam engineers and AI experts, the paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the subject. The paper is structured into three parts. Part 1 offers a concise introduction to AI, covering its historical background, major categories, and current state of development. In Part 2, the focus shifts to the specific applications of AI in hydropower and dam engineering. This section delves into the utilization of AI for predictive modeling, real-time monitoring, optimization, and planning and design. Notable case studies and examples of machine learning techniques applied to predictive models and numerical simulations in the context of dams and levees are also discussed. Part 3 explores the current and emerging technologies being implemented in the industry, including automated decision-making systems and the use of AI-powered drones for efficient dam inspection. Additionally, the section sheds light on the challenges that must be addressed to fully integrate AI into dam engineering practices. This paper targets dam engineers, AI experts, and individuals interested in the intersection of these fields. Its primary contribution lies in providing a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the applications, challenges, and potential future developments of AI in dam engineering. Over 3300 articles on the intersection of dam engineering and AI were identified, and approximately 550 articles (about 17\%) were further processed for inclusion in this study. Moreover, it emphasizes the need for robust data management, algorithmic transparency, and ethical considerations in the implementation of AI systems.},

  abstract = {Dam deformation is an intuitive and reliable monitoring indicator for dam structural response. With the increase in the service life of the project, the structural response and environmental quantity data collected by the structural health monitoring (SHM) system show a geometric growth trend. The traditional hydraulic-seasonal-time (HST) model shows poor performance in dealing with massive monitoring data due to the multidimensional data collinearity problem and the inaccurate temperature field simulations. To address these problems, this study proposes a data-driven dam deformation monitoring model for dealing with massive monitoring data based on the light gradient boosting tree (LGB) and Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm. The proposed BO--LGB method can mine the underlying relationship between temperature changes and dam deformation instead of simple harmonic functions. Moreover, LGB is used to simulate the relationship between highdimensional environmental quantity data and dam displacement changes, and the BO algorithm is used to determine the optimal hyperparameter selection of LGB based on massive monitoring data. A concrete dam in long-term service was used as the case study, and three typical dam displacement monitoring points were used for model training and validation. The experimental results have indicated that the method can properly consider the collinearity in variables, and has a good balance in modeling accuracy and efficiency when dealing with high-dimensional large-scale dam monitoring data. Moreover, the proposed method can explain the contribution difference between different input variables to select the factors with a more significant influence on modeling.},

  abstract = {A failure of a massive concrete dam could cause catastrophic consequences. The purpose of monitoring is to detect anomalies and damage at an early stage to prevent failure. Data-based models for anomaly detection are based on the hypothesis that the behaviour of an undamaged dam will follow an expected pattern, and deviation from this pattern is an indication of damage. In this study, simulations were used to create time series for an undamaged dam and three different damage scenarios at three different locations in the dam body. Three common data-based models were used to predict a dams crest displacements, both on the generated artificial data and the corresponding measurements from the dam. Prediction bands for future measurements were created, and the ten time-series were used to test the ability to detect damage. All models could detect instantaneous damage but struggle to detect progressive damage; the Neural network outperforms the two regression models. The choice of the mathematically optimal threshold limit leads to a large number of false alerts. Requiring three consecutive values outside the threshold before an alert is issued, increases the possibility to receive an early alert compared to the standard approach where observations are classified individually.},

  abstract = {Landslide displacement prediction is an essential base of landslide hazard prevention, which often needs to establish an accurate prediction model. To achieve accuracy prediction of landslide displacement, a displacement prediction model based on a salp-swarm-algorithm-optimized temporal convolutional network (SSA-TCN) is proposed. The TCN model, consisting of a causal dilation convolution layer residual block, can flexibly increase the receptive fields and capture the global information in a deeper layer. SSA can solve the hyperparameter problem well for TCN model. The Muyubao landslide displacement collected from a professional GPS monitoring system implemented in 2006 is used to analyze the displacement features of the slope and evaluate the performance of the SSA-TCN model. The cumulative displacement time series is decomposed into trend displacement (linear part) and periodic displacement (nonlinear part) by the variational modal decomposition (VMD) method. Then, a polynomial function is used to predict the trend displacement, and the SSA-TCN model is used to predict the periodic displacement of the landslide based on considering the response relationship between periodic displacement, rainfall, and reservoir water. This research also compares the proposed approach results with the other popular machine learning and deep learning models. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model is superior to and more effective and accurate than the others at predicting the landslide displacement.},

  abstract = {Forecasting reservoir water levels is essential in water supply management, impacting both operations and intervention strategies. This paper examines the short-term and long-term forecasting performance of several statistical and machine learning-based methods for predicting the water levels of the Angat Dam in the Philippines. A total of six forecasting methods are compared: na\"ive/persistence; seasonal mean; autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA); gradient boosting machines (GBM); and two deep neural networks (DNN) using a long short-term memorybased (LSTM) encoder-decoder architecture: a univariate model (DNN-U) and a multivariate model (DNN-M). Daily historical water levels from 2001 to 2021 are used in predicting future water levels. In addition, we include meteorological data (rainfall and the Oceanic Ni\~no Index) and irrigation data as exogenous variables. To evaluate the forecast accuracy of our methods, we use a time series cross-validation approach to establish a more robust estimate of the error statistics. Our results show that our DNN-U model has the best accuracy in the 1-day-ahead scenario with a mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.2 m. In the 30-day-, 90-day-, and 180-day-ahead scenarios, the DNN-M shows the best performance with MAE (RMSE) scores of 2.9 (3.3), 5.1 (6.0), and 6.7 (8.1) meters, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate that further improvements in performance are possible by scanning over all possible combinations of the exogenous variables and only using a subset of them as features. In summary, we provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating water level forecasting by defining a baseline accuracy, analyzing performance across multiple prediction horizons, using time series cross-validation to assess accuracy and uncertainty, and examining the effects of exogenous variables on forecasting performance. In the process, our work addresses several notable gaps in the methodologies of previous works.},

  abstract = {Accurate mapping of dams can provide useful information about geographical locations and boundaries and can help improve public dam datasets. However, when applied to disaster emergency management, it is often difficult to completely determine the distribution of dams due to the incompleteness of the available data. Thus, we propose an automatic and intelligent extraction method that combines location with post-segmentation for dam detection. First, we constructed a dataset named RSDams and proposed an object detection model, YOLOv5s-ViT-BiFPN (You Only Look Once version 5s-Vision Transformer-Bi-Directional Feature Pyramid Network), with a training method using deep transfer learning to generate graphical locations for dams. After retraining the model on the RSDams dataset, its precision for dam detection reached 88.2\% and showed a 3.4\% improvement over learning from scratch. Second, based on the graphical locations, we utilized an improved Morphological Building Index (MBI) algorithm for dam segmentation to derive dam masks. The average overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the model applied to 100 images reached 97.4\% and 0.7, respectively. Finally, we applied the dam extraction method to two study areas, namely, Yangbi County of Yunnan Province and Changping District of Beijing in China, and the recall rates reached 69.2\% and 81.5\%, respectively. The results show that our method has high accuracy and good potential to serve as an automatic and intelligent method for the establishment of a public dam dataset on a regional or national scale.},

Traditionally, statistical model is widely applied in practical engineering for structural health monitoring. In this paper, an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based health monitoring model is proposed for displacement prediction of gravity dams. ELM is one type of feedforward neural networks with a single layer of hidden nodes, where the weights connecting inputs to hidden nodes are randomly assigned. The model can produce good generalization performance and learns faster than networks trained using the back propagation algorithm. The advantages such as easy operating, high prediction accuracy, and fast training speed of the ELM health monitoring model are verified by monitoring data of a real concrete dam. Results are also compared with that of the back propagation neural networks, multiple linear regression, and stepwise regression models for dam health monitoring.},

  abstract = {Spatial continuous data (spatial continuous surfaces) play a significant role in planning, risk assessment and decision making in environmental management. They are, however, usually not readily available and often difficult and expensive to acquire, especially for mountainous and deep marine regions. As geographic information systems (GIS) and modelling techniques are becoming powerful tools in natural resource management and biological conservation, spatial continuous data of environmental variables are increasingly required. Environmental managers often require spatial continuous data over a region of interest to make effective and informed decisions and scientists need accurate data which are well-distributed across a region to make justified interpretations. However, spatial distribution data of natural phenomena are often collected from point sources. The marine environment in Australia is a typical case, where: seabed mapping, habitat classification, and prediction of marine biodiversity, essential for marine biodiversity conservation, need reliable spatial continuous data of the marine environment. In most of the Australian marine region, such data are not available, and only sparsely and unevenly scattered point samples have been collected. Therefore, spatial interpolation techniques are essential for estimating biophysical variables for the unsampled locations.},

  abstract = {Hydraulic engineering plays an important role in energy construction in China. As the most important water retaining structure, the deformation trend and safety state of dam is undoubtedly the most concerned problem in engineering. Dam deformation monitoring data is the most critical information to understand dam deformation. So, the analysis and prediction of dam deformation monitoring data is an important measure to master dam safety state. However, the monitoring data of dam generally contains noise components. In order to reduce the noise influence and improve the stability and accuracy of dam monitoring data. EMD-SARIMA model was established in this paper. The monitoring data was decomposed into several Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) from high to low frequency by using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). Then, the data was reconstructed after eliminating the IMF mainly containing noise based on the Continuous Mean Square Error (CMSE) criterion. Finally, a Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model was established for the reconstructed data. The results show that EMD can effectively reduce the noise in dam monitoring data. The reconstructed data is more stable than the original data, and closer to the actual displacement process of the dam. Compared with SARIMA model, the prediction accuracy of EMD-SARIMA model meets the requirements, and is more accurate and less noise effect. It can be applied to denoise data and prediction analysis of gravity dam.},

  abstract = {In response to the abnormal data mining in dam safety monitoring, and based on the traditional spectral clustering, this paper presents an anomaly detection method based on improved spectral clustering. This method applies a distance and density adaptive similarity measure. The natural eigenvalue is introduced to adaptively select the neighbors of data points, and the similarity is redefined to be combined with the natural k-nearest neighbor. Furthermore, the shared neighbor is introduced to adjust the similarity between the monitoring data samples according to the regional density. Moreover, considering the distribution of dam monitoring data, the initialization of clustering centers is optimized according to both the density and distance feature. This method can prevent the algorithm from local optimum, better adapt to the density of non-convex dataset, reduce the number of iterations, and enhance the efficiencies of clustering and anomaly detection. Taking the dam slab monitoring data as the research object, experimental datasets are formed. Experiments on these datasets further verify that the method of this paper can effectively adapt to discrete distribution datasets and is superior to the classical spectral clustering method in both clustering and anomaly detection.},

Compared with traditional monitoring methods, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has the advantages of large scale and high accuracy. Based on the small baseline subset InSAR, 187 ascending and 102 descending SAR images obtained from Sentinel-1 were used to detect the deformation along the diversion canal from 2017 to 2023. The results show that there was a sinking trend along the diversion canal. The subsidence was serious in the first half of the canal, and continued to sink from 2019 to 2020. The subsidence was alleviated in 2023. Combined with leveling measurements, the InSAR deformation monitoring results of important pumping station buildings were verified. The measurement accuracy of InSAR can reach the millimeter level. We extracted the groundwater level time series and subsidence for risky canal segments. Through pixel-by-pixel comparison, it was found that fluctuations in groundwater level would have some impact on surface deformation. Severe local subsidence or uplift deformation occasionally occurred. To ensure the safety of water diversion, the monitoring and maintenance of relevant pump station buildings in risky areas should be increased in the future.},

  abstract = {Ageing stock and extreme weather events pose a threat to the safety of infrastructure networks. In most countries, funding allocated to infrastructure management is insufficient to perform systematic inspections over large transport networks. As a result, early signs of distress can develop unnoticed, potentially leading to catastrophic structural failures. Over the past 20 years, a wealth of literature has demonstrated the capability of satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) to accurately detect surface deformations of different types of assets. Thanks to the high accuracy and spatial density of measurements, and a short revisit time, space-borne remote-sensing techniques have the potential to provide a cost-effective and near real-time monitoring tool. Whilst InSAR techniques offer an effective approach for structural health monitoring, they also provide a large amount of data. For civil engineering procedures, these need to be analysed in combination with large infrastructure inventories. Over a regional scale, the manual extraction of InSAR-derived displacements from individual assets is extremely time-consuming and an automated integration of the two datasets is essential to effectively assess infrastructure systems. This paper presents a new methodology based on the fully automated integration of InSAR-based measurements and Geographic Information System-infrastructure inventories to detect potential warnings over extensive transport networks. A Sentinel dataset from 2016 to 2019 is used to analyse the Los Angeles highway and freeway network, while the Italian motorway network is evaluated by using open access ERS/Envisat datasets between 1992 and 2010, COSMO-SkyMed datasets between 2008 and 2014 and Sentinel datasets between 2014 and 2020. To demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed methodology to different SAR sensors and infrastructure classes, the analysis of bridges and viaducts in the two test areas is also performed. The outcomes highlight the potential of the proposed methodology to be integrated into structural health monitoring systems and improve current procedures for transport network management.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has been extensively applied to model geohazards, yielding tremendous success. However, researchers and practitioners still face challenges in enhancing the reliability of ML models. In the present study, a systematic framework combining k-fold cross-validation (CV), metaheuristics (MHs), support vector regression (SVR), and Friedman and Nemenyi tests was proposed to improve the reliability and performance of geohazard modeling. The average normalized mean square error (NMSE) from k-fold CV sets was adopted as the fitness metric. Twenty of the most well-established MHs and the most recent MHs were adopted to tune the hyperparameters of SVR and were evaluated through nonparametric Friedman and post hoc Nemenyi tests to identify significant differences. Observations from a typical reservoir landslide were selected as a benchmark dataset, and the accuracy, robustness, computational time, and convergence speed of the MHs were compared. Significant performance differences among the twenty MHs were identified by Friedman and post hoc Nemenyi tests of the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), Kling--Gupta efficiency (KGE), and computational time, with p values lower than 0.05. The comparison of results demonstrated that the multiverse optimizer (MVO) is among the highest-performing, most stable, and computationally efficient algorithms, providing superior performance to other methods, with nearly optimum values of the correlation coefficient (R), a low MAE (23.5086 versus 23.9360), a low mean RMSE (48.6946 versus 50.1882), and a high mean KGE (0.9803 versus 0.9893) in predicting the displacement of the Shuping landslide. This paper considerably enriches the literature regarding hyperparameter optimization algorithms and the enhancement of their reliability. In addition, Friedman and post hoc Nemenyi tests have the potential for evaluating and comparing various ML-based geohazard models.},

  abstract = {Slope deformation prediction is crucial for early warning of slope failure, which can prevent property damage and save human life. Existing predictive models focus on predicting the displacement of a single monitoring point based on time series data, without considering spatial correlations among monitoring points, which makes it difficult to reveal the displacement changes in the entire monitoring system and ignores the potential threats from nonselected points. To address the above problem, this paper presents a novel deep learning method for predicting the slope deformation, by considering the spatial correlations between all points in the entire displacement monitoring system. The essential idea behind the proposed method is to predict the slope deformation based on the global information (i.e., the correlated displacements of all points in the entire monitoring system), rather than based on the local information (i.e., the displacements of a specified single point in the monitoring system). In the proposed method, (1) a weighted adjacency matrix is built to interpret the spatial correlations between all points, (2) a feature matrix is assembled to store the time-series displacements of all points, and (3) one of the state-of-the-art deep learning models, i.e., T-GCN, is developed to process the above graph-structured data consisting of two matrices. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by performing predictions based on a real dataset. The proposed method can be applied to predict time-dependency information in other similar geohazard scenarios, based on time-series data collected from multiple monitoring points.},

  abstract = {In the context of dam deformation monitoring, the prediction task is essentially a time series prediction problem that involves non-stationarity and complex influencing factors. To enhance the accuracy of predictions and address the challenges posed by high randomness and parameter selection in LSTM models, a novel approach called sparrow search algorithm--long short-term memory (SSA--LSTM) has been proposed for predicting the deformation of concrete dams. SSA--LSTM combines the SSA optimization algorithm with LSTM to automatically optimize the model's parameters, thereby enhancing the prediction performance. Firstly, a concrete dam was used as an example to preprocess the historical monitoring data by cleaning, normalizing, and denoising, and due to the specificity of the data structure, multi-level denoising of abnormal data was performed. Second, some of the data were used to train the model, and the hyperparameters of the long and short-term memory neural network model (LSTM) were optimized by the SSA algorithm to better match the input data with the network structure. Finally, high-precision prediction of concrete dam deformation was carried out. The proposed model in this study significantly improves the prediction accuracy in dam deformation forecasting and demonstrates effectiveness in long-term time series deformation prediction. The model provides a reliable and efficient approach for evaluating the long-term stability of dam structures, offering valuable insights for engineering practices and decision-making.},

Moreover, despite Structural Health Monitoring systems being sparsely installed, no research has quantified the global potential of this spaceborne radar-based technique as a complementary monitoring solution for bridges. This study introduces a method that integrates monitoring availability into structural vulnerability assessments and evaluates the global risk of long-span bridges affected by subsidence and landslides. Findings revealed that while fewer than 20\% of bridges have Structural Health Monitoring systems, spaceborne monitoring could provide monitoring for over 60\% of structures, leveraging Sentinel-1's global coverage. Incorporating this satellite remote sensing approach into routine assessments could decrease the number of bridges classified as high-risk by one-third. Moreover, half of the remaining high-risk structures could benefit from spaceborne monitoring, highlighting the technique's potential to enhance structural safety and resilience, especially in economically disadvantaged regions.},

In recent years, there is an increase in the use of data-based models for the analysis and interpretation of the structural behaviour of dams. Multiple Linear Regression is the conventional, widely used approach in dam engineering, although interesting results have been published based on machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, random forest, and boosted regression trees. However, these models need to be carefully developed and properly assessed before their application in practice. This is even more relevant when an increase in users of machine learning models is expected. For this reason, this paper presents extensive work regarding the verification and validation of data-based models for the analysis and interpretation of observed dam's behaviour. This is presented by means of the development of several machine learning models to interpret horizontal displacements in an arch dam in operation. Several validation techniques are applied, including historical data validation, sensitivity analysis, and predictive validation.

We demonstrate this method with a set of 170 million time series of surface deformation generated for the entire Italian territory and derived from ERS, ENVISAT, and COSMO-SkyMed Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite constellations. We create a training dataset that has been compared with independently validated data and current state-of-the-art classification techniques.

This study highlights how the proposed approach can accelerate the anomalous points identification step by up to 147 times compared to analytical and other artificial intelligence methods and can be theoretically extended to other geodetic measurements such as GPS, leveling data, or extensometers. Our results indicate that the proposed approach would make the anomaly identification post-processing times negligible when compared to the InSAR time-series processing.},

  abstract = {Early alarm systems can activate vital precautions for saving lives and the economy threatened by natural hazards and human activities. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) products generate valuable ground motion data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Integrating the InSAR products and forecasting models make possible to set up early alarm systems to monitor vulnerable areas. This study proposes a technical support to early warning detection tools of ground instabilities using machine learning and InSAR time series that is capable of forecasting regions affected by potential collapses. A long short-term memory (LSTM) model is tailored to predict ground movements in three forecast ranges (i.e., SAR observations): 3, 4, and 5 multistep. A contribution of the proposed strategy is utilizing adjacent time series to decrease the possibility of falsely detecting safe regions as significant movements. The proposed tool offers ground motion-based outcomes that can be interpreted and utilized by experts to activate early alarms to reduce the consequences of possible failures in vulnerable infrastructures, such as mining areas. Three case studies in Spain, Brazil, and Australia, where fatal incidents happened, are analyzed by the proposed early alert detector to illustrate the impact of chosen temporal and spatial ranges. Since most early alarm systems are site dependent, we propose a general tool to be interpreted by experts for activating reliable alarms. The results show that the proposed tool can identify potential regions before collapse in all case studies. In addition, the tool can suggest an optimum selection of InSAR temporal (i.e., number of images) and spatial (i.e., adjacent measurement points) combinations based on the available SAR images and the characteristics of the study area.},

  abstract = {The increasing availability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images facilitates the generation of rich Differential Interferometric SAR (DInSAR) data. Temporal analysis of DInSAR products, and in particular deformation Time Series (TS), enables advanced investigations for ground deformation identification. Machine Learning algorithms offer efficient tools for classifying large volumes of data. In this study, we train supervised Machine Learning models using 5000 reference samples of three datasets to classify DInSAR TS in five deformation trends: Stable, Linear, Quadratic, Bilinear, and Phase Unwrapping Error. General statistics and advanced features are also computed from TS to assess the classification performance. The proposed methods reported accuracy values greater than 0.90, whereas the customized features significantly increased the performance. Besides, the importance of customized features was analysed in order to identify the most effective features in TS classification. The proposed models were also tested on 15000 unlabelled data and compared to a model-based method to validate their reliability. Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting could accurately classify reference samples and positively assign correct labels to random samples. This study indicates the efficiency of Machine Learning models in the classification and management of DInSAR TSs, along with shortcomings of the proposed models in classification of nonmoving targets (i.e., false alarm rate) and a decreasing accuracy for shorter TS.},

  abstract = {The paper explores the potential of the satellite advanced differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (A-DInSAR) technique for the identification of impending slope failure. The advantages and limitations of satellite InSAR in monitoring pre-failure landslide behaviour are addressed in five different case histories back-analysed using data acquired by different satellite missions: Montescaglioso landslide (2013, Italy), Scillato landslide (2015, Italy), Bingham Canyon Mine landslide (2013, UT, USA), Big Sur landslide (2017, CA, USA) and Xinmo landslide (2017, China). This paper aimed at providing a contribution to improve the knowledge within the subject area of landslide forecasting using monitoring data, in particular exploring the suitability of satellite InSAR for spatial and temporal prediction of large landslides. The study confirmed that satellite InSAR can be successful in the early detection of slopes prone to collapse; its limitations due to phase aliasing and low sampling frequency are also underlined. According to the results, we propose a novel landslide predictability classification discerning five different levels of predictability by satellite InSAR. Finally, the big step forward made for landslide forecasting applications since the beginning of the first SAR systems (ERS and Envisat) is shown, highlighting that future perspectives are encouraging thanks to the expected improvement of upcoming satellite missions that could highly increase the capability to monitor landslides' pre-failure behaviour.},

In India, the number of large-scale landslides and their damage seems to be increasing in recent years. Due to the lack of inaccurate prediction methods and effective early warning systems, the destruction caused by landslides is magnified. The existing system uses a lower number of factors and does not provide a method for ensuring the safety of the user. As a result, it is not effective in predicting and mitigating landslides. The proposed system allows for the mitigation of destruction to life caused by landslides, by providing them with routes to safe regions. The system receives the user's location and uses GPS to find the route to the safe zone. The model incorporates more landslide factors to ensure more accuracy in the prediction of landslides. As a result, the proposed model is more effective in the prediction and mitigation of landslides and the destruction it causes to human life.},

  abstract = {Accurate early warning systems for landslides are a reliable risk-reduction strategy that may significantly reduce fatalities and economic losses. Several machine learning methods have been examined for this purpose, underlying deep learning (DL) models' remarkable prediction capabilities. The long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) algorithms are the sole DL model studied in the extant comparisons. However, several other DL algorithms are suitable for time series forecasting tasks. In this paper, we assess, compare, and describe seven DL methods for forecasting future landslide displacement: multi-layer perception (MLP), LSTM, GRU, 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN), 2xLSTM, bidirectional LSTM (bi-LSTM), and an architecture composed of 1D CNN and LSTM (Conv-LSTM). The investigation focuses on four landslides with different geographic locations, geological settings, time step dimensions, and measurement instruments. Two landslides are located in an artificial reservoir context, while the displacement of the other two is influenced just by rainfall. The results reveal that the MLP, GRU, and LSTM models can make reliable predictions in all four scenarios, while the ConvLSTM model outperforms the others in the Baishuihe landslide, where the landslide is highly seasonal. No evident performance differences were found for landslides inside artificial reservoirs rather than outside. Furthermore, the research shows that MLP is better adapted to forecast the highest displacement peaks, while LSTM and GRU are better suited to model lower displacement peaks. We believe the findings of this research will serve as a precious aid when implementing a DL-based landslide early warning system (LEWS).},

  abstract = {Monitoring structural stability in urban areas and infrastructure networks is emerging as one of the dominant socio-economic issues for population security. The problem is accentuated by the age of the infrastructure because of increasing risks due to material deterioration and loss of load capacity. In this case, SAR satellite data are crucial to identify and assess the deteriorating conditions of civil infrastructures. The large amount of data available from SAR satellite sensors leads to the exploitation and development of new GIS-based procedures for rapid responses and decision making. In recent decades, the DInSAR technique has been used efficiently for the monitoring of structures, providing measurement points located on structures with millimeter precision. Our study has analyzed the behavior of structures in settlements, attempting to discuss the interactions of soil and structures, and examining the behavior of different types of structures, such as roads and buildings. The method used is based on long-term SAR interferometry data and a semi-automatic procedure to measure the displacement (mm/year) of structures, through a GIS-based application performed in the ``Implemented MOnitoring DIsplacement'' I.MODI platform. The analysis provides extensive information on long-term spatial and temporal continuity of up to 25 years of record, using satellite SAR multi-sensors from ERS, Envisat, and COSMO-SkyMed. The interpretation uses time series spatial analysis, supported by orthophotos, and layers of the DBTR (regional topographic database), Digital Surface model (DSM), and hydrogeological map to show anomalous areas with a high displacement rate and to observe the correlation of settlements in the sediments. With the satellite information and Geographic Information System (GIS), we were able to observe relevant parameters, such as the velocity of advance in the direction of the slope (deformation profiles), the cumulative displacement, and the trend changes in structures. The results illustrate an innovative procedure that allows the management of DInSAR data to facilitate the effective management of structures in which a monitoring protocol was developed at different spatial scales, integrating the information into a GIS.},

The advent of advanced sensing, storage, and networking technologies has resulted in high-dimensional time-series data, however, posing significant challenges for analyzing latent structures over extended temporal scales. Time-series clustering, an established unsupervised learning strategy that groups similar time series together, helps unveil hidden patterns in these complex datasets. In this survey, we trace the evolution of time-series clustering methods from classical approaches to recent advances in neural networks. While previous surveys have focused on specific methodological categories, we bridge the gap between traditional clustering methods and emerging deep learning-based algorithms, presenting a comprehensive, unified taxonomy for this research area. This survey highlights key developments and provides insights to guide future research in time-series clustering.},

  abstract = {Tailings dams constructed using the upstream method generally have relatively low- density materials with a high degree of saturation. Such conditions can generate the phenomena of liquefaction, which is potentially critical in slurry tailings disposal systems. Slope stability analyses involving liquefied soil require that the shear resistance of the softened soil be estimated and then, a good practical alternative is back-analyzed with field case studies involving slope failures, using commonly SPT and CPT results. The Olson (2001) and Olson \& Stark (2003b) liquefaction analysis methodology based on strength ratios, included in this approach, is comprised of three stages: (i) liquefaction susceptibility analysis; (ii) triggering analysis; and (iii) post-triggering - flow failure stability analysis. In this paper, this approach was applied for stability assessments to verify liquefaction potential in an upstream tailings dam built by the hydraulic fill technique and located in the Quadril\'atero Ferr\'ifero (Iron Quadrangle) region, southeastern of Brazil. The results ratified the safety condition of the impoundment although they have demonstrated that the tailings tend to exhibit contractile behavior during shear, indicating liquefaction susceptibility.},

  abstract = {Development of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology and the dedicated suite of processing tools have aided the evolution of remote sensing techniques for various Earth Observation (EO) applications. Interferometric SAR (InSAR) is a relatively new geodetic technique which provides high-speed and reliable geographic, geologic, and hazards information allowing the prognosis of future environmental and urban planning. In this study, we explored the applicability of two differential interferometry techniques, conventional and advanced differential InSAR (A-DInSAR), for topographic mapping and long-term geotechnical monitoring by exploiting satellite data, particularly Sentinel-1 SAR data, which is publicly shared. We specifically used the open-source tools of SeNtinel Application Platform (SNAP) and Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) for interferometric data processing to implement A-DInSAR. This study presents various applications, which include generation of a digital elevation model (DEM), mapping of seismically induced displacement and associated damages, and detection and long-term monitoring of tunneling-induced ground deformation and rainfall-induced landslide. Geometric and temporal decorrelations posed challenges and limitations in the successful implementation of Sentinel-1 SAR interferometry specifically in vegetated areas. The presented results proved the validity and reliability of the exploited SAR data and InSAR techniques for addressing geotechnical engineering related problems.},

  abstract = {Tailings storage facilities (TSFs) impound mining waste behind dams to ensure public safety, but failure incidents have prompted calls for more robust monitoring programs. Satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has grown in popularity due to its ability to remotely detect millimeter-scale displacements in most urban and some natural terrains. However, there remains a limited understanding of whether InSAR can be as accurate or representative as on-theground instruments, whether failures can be predicted in advance using InSAR, and what variables govern the quality and reliability of InSAR results. To address these gaps, we analyze open-source, medium-resolution Sentinel-1 data to undertake a ground-truth assessment at a test site and a forensic analysis of five failure cases. We use a commercial software with an automated Persistent Scatterer (PS) workflow (SARScape Analytics) for all case study sites except one and a proprietary algorithm (SqueeSAR) with a dual PS and Distributed Scatterer (DS) algorithm for the ground-truth site and one forensic case. The main goal is to deliver practical insights regarding the influence of algorithm/satellite selection, environmental conditions, site activity, coherence thresholds, satellite-dam geometry, and failure modes. We conclude that Sentinel-1 InSAR can serve as a hazard-screening tool to help guide where to undertake targeted investigations; however, most potential failure modes may not exhibit InSAR-detectable accelerations that could assist with time-of-failure prediction in real time. As such, long-term monitoring programs should ideally be integrated with a combination of remote sensing and field instrumentation to best support engineering practice and judgment.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Climate change and the associated rise in air temperature have affected the Tibetan Plateau to a significantly stronger degree than the global average over the past decades. This has caused deglaciation, increased precipitation and permafrost degradation. The latter in particular is associated with increased slope instability and an increase in mass-wasting processes, which pose a danger to infrastructure in the vicinity. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis is well suited to study the displacement patterns driven by permafrost processes, as they are on the order of millimeters to decimeters. The Nyainq\^entanglha range on the Tibetan Plateau lacks high vegetation and features relatively thin snow cover in winter, allowing for continuous monitoring of those displacements throughout the year. The short revisit time of the Sentinel-1 constellation further reduces the risk of temporal decorrelation, making it possible to produce surface displacement models with good spatial coverage. We created three different surface displacement models to study heave and subsidence in the valleys, seasonally accelerated sliding and linear creep on the slopes. Flat regions at Nam Co are mostly stable on a multiannual scale but some experience subsidence. We observe a clear cycle of heave and subsidence in the valleys, where freezing of the active layer followed by subsequent thawing cause a vertical oscillation of the ground of up to a few centimeters, especially near streams and other water bodies. Most slopes of the area are unstable, with velocities of 8 to 17\,mm\,yr-1. During the summer months surface displacement velocities more than double on most unstable slopes due to freeze--thaw processes driven by higher temperatures and increased precipitation. Specific landforms, most of which have been identified as rock glaciers, protalus ramparts or frozen moraines, reach velocities of up to 18\,cm\,yr-1. Their movement shows little seasonal variation but a linear pattern indicating that their displacement is predominantly gravity-driven.},

  abstract = {The protection of critical engineering infrastructures is vital to today's society, not only to ensure the maintenance of their services (e.g., water supply, energy production, transport), but also to avoid large-scale disasters. Therefore, technical and financial efforts are being continuously made to improve the safety control of large civil engineering structures like dams, bridges and nuclear facilities. This control is based on the measurement of physical quantities that characterize the structural behavior, such as displacements, strains and stresses. The analysis of monitoring data and its evaluation against physical and mathematical models is the strongest tool to assess the safety of the structural behavior. Commonly, dam specialists use multiple linear regression models to analyze the dam response, which is a wellknown approach among dam engineers since the 1950s decade. Nowadays, the data acquisition paradigm is changing from a manual process, where measurements were taken with low frequency (e.g., on a weekly basis), to a fully automated process that allows much higher frequencies. This new paradigm escalates the potential of data analytics on top of monitoring data, but, on the other hand, increases data quality issues related to anomalies in the acquisition process. This chapter presents the full data lifecycle in the safety control of large-scale civil engineering infrastructures (focused on dams), from the data acquisition process, data processing and storage, data quality and outlier detection, and data analysis. A strong focus is made on the use of machine learning techniques for data analysis, where the common multiple linear regression analysis is compared with deep learning strategies, namely recurrent neural networks. Demonstration scenarios are presented based on data obtained from monitoring systems of concrete dams under operation in Portugal.},

  abstract = {Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has proved its efficiency for displacement monitoring in urban areas. However, the large volume of data generated by this technology turns the retrieval of information useful for structure monitoring into a big data problem. In this study, a new tool (SARClust) to analyze InSAR displacement time series is proposed. The tool performs the clustering of persistent scatterers (PSs) based on dissimilarities between their displacement time series evaluated through dynamic time warping. This strategy leads to the formation of clusters containing PSs with similar displacements, which can be analyzed together, reducing data dimensionality, and facilitating the identification of displacement patterns potentially related to structural damage. A proof of concept was performed for downtown Lisbon, Portugal, where ten distinct displacement patterns were identified. A relationship between clusters presenting centimeter-level displacements and buildings located on steep slopes was observed. The results were validated through visual inspections and comparison with another tool for time series analysis. Agreement was found in both cases. The innovation in this study is the attention brought to SARClust's ability to (i) analyze vertical and horizontal displacements simultaneously, using an unsupervised procedure, and (ii) characterize PSs assisting the displacement interpretation. The main finding is the strategy to identify signs of structure damage, even on isolated buildings, in a large amount of InSAR data. In conclusion, SARClust is of the utmost importance to detect potential signs of structural damage in InSAR displacement time series, supporting structure safety experts in more efficient and sustainable monitoring tasks.},

The long-term monitoring (2,217 days) of the rock slope carried out by a Terrestrial LiDAR allowed the early detection of both pre-failure deformation and precursory rockfalls preceding the final failure. By means of the analysis of the pre-failure deformation, four different deformed areas were detected and the tertiary creep phase was observed in three of them. An attempt to predict the time to failure was performed using the Fukuzono's (1985) method. Furthermore, the temporal evolution of the precursory rockfalls occurred in those four areas during the progressive failure showed a close resemblance with the exponential pattern of the cumulated displacements at tertiary creep stage. Finally, the study of the meteorological conditions did not show any single triggering factor associated with the final failure. Reversely, the increase in the occurrence of precursory rockfalls on several areas of the slope together with the observed acceleration on the deformation pattern reinforce the role of a progressive degradation of the stability conditions, which ultimately leaded to the 3 December rockfall event.},

The exact date of failure was obtained based on a photographic monitoring performed every 4 h. The long-term monitoring (2,217 days) of the rock slope carried out by a Terrestrial LiDAR allowed the early detection of both pre-failure deformation and precursory rockfalls preceding the final failure. By means of the analysis of the pre-failure deformation, four different deformed areas were detected and the tertiary creep phase was observed in three of them. An attempt to predict the time to failure was performed using the Fukuzono's (1985) method. Furthermore, the temporal evolution of the precursory rockfalls occurred in those four areas during the progressive failure showed a close resemblance with the exponential pattern of the cumulated displacements at tertiary creep stage. Finally, the study of the meteorological conditions did not show any single triggering factor associated with the final failure. Reversely, the increase in the occurrence of precursory rockfalls on several areas of the slope together with the observed acceleration on the deformation pattern reinforce the role of a progressive degradation of the stability conditions, which ultimately leaded to the 3 December rockfall event.},

  author = {Salazar, Fernando and Gonz{\'a}lez, Jos{\'e} M and Toledo, Miguel {\'A} and O{\~n}ate, Eugenio},
  abstract = {Many countries are implementing new dam safety regulations that often include more restrictive standards. This, together with the increasing average age of dams, results in a greater need for dam control and maintenance works. The advances in information and communications technologies improved the performance of dam monitoring systems, so a large amount of information on the dam behaviour can be collected. This has led to the use of more powerful tools for its analysis, many of which were first developed in the field of machine learning (e. g. neural networks). They offer some advantages over the conventional statistical methods. However, their capacity for early detection of anomalies has seldom been studied. As a result, they are far from being fully accepted by practitioners, whose analyses are often restricted to the interpretation of simple plots of time series data, together with basic statistical models. The present work describes a methodology for anomaly detection in dam behaviour, with the following features: a) The prediction model is based on boosted regression trees (BRTs). b) Causal and auto-regressive models are combined to detect different types of anomalies. c) It is checked whether the values of the external variables fall within the range of the training data. The performance of the proposed methodology was assessed through its application to a test case corresponding to an actual 100-m height arch dam, in operation since 1980. Artificial data were generated by means of a finite element model. Different anomalies were later added in order to test the anomaly detection capability. The method can be applied to other response variables and dam typologies, due to the great flexibility of BRTs, which automatically select the most relevant inputs.},

This is done separately for each response variable, and the results are later interpreted before decision making. In this work, three approaches based on machine learning classifiers are evaluated for the joint analysis of a set of monitoring variables: multiclass, two-class and one-class classification. Support vector machines are applied to all prediction tasks, and random forest is also used for multi-class and two-class. The results show high accuracy for multi-class classification, although the approach has limitations for practical use. The performance in two-class classification is strongly dependent on the features of the anomalies to detect and their similarity to those used for model fitting. The one-class classification model based on support vector machines showed high prediction accuracy, while avoiding the need for correctly selecting and modelling the potential anomalies. A criterion for anomaly detection based on model predictions is defined, which results in a decrease in the misclassification rate. The possibilities and limitations of all three approaches for practical use are discussed.},

  abstract = {Dam behaviour is difficult to predict with high accuracy. Numerical models for structural calculation solve the equations of continuum mechanics, but are subject to considerable uncertainty as to the characterisation of materials, especially with regard to the foundation. As a result, these models are often incapable to calculate dam behaviour with sufficient precision. Thus, it is difficult to determine whether a given deviation between model results and monitoring data represent a relevant anomaly or incipient failure.   By contrast, there is a tendency towards automatising dam monitoring devices, which allows for increasing the reading frequency and results in a greater amount and variety of data available, such as displacements, leakage, or interstitial pressure, among others.  This increasing volume of dam monitoring data makes it interesting to study the ability of advanced tools to extract useful information from observed variables.   In particular, in the field of Machine Learning (ML), powerful algorithms have been developed to face problems where the amount of data is much larger or the underlying phenomena is much less understood.   In this thesis, the possibilities of machine learning techniques were analysed for application to dam structural analysis based on monitoring data. The typical characteristics of the data sets available in dam safety were taking into account, as regards their nature, quality and size.  A critical literature review was performed, from which the key issues to consider for implementation of these algorithms in dam safety were identified. A comparative study of the accuracy of a set of algorithms for predicting dam behaviour was carried out, considering radial and tangential displacements and leakage flow in a 100-m high dam. The results suggested that the algorithm called ``Boosted Regression Trees'' (BRT) is the most suitable, being more accurate in general, while flexible and relatively easy to implement.   At a later stage, the possibilities of interpretation of the mentioned algorithm were evaluated, to identify the shape and intensity of the association between external variables and the dam response, as well as the effect of time. The tools were applied to the same test case, and allowed more accurate identification of the time effect than the traditional statistical method.   Finally, a methodology for the implementation of predictive models based on BRT for early detection of anomalies was developed and implemented in an interactive tool that provides information on dam behaviour, through a set of selected devices. It allows the user to easily verify whether the actual data for each of these devices are within a pre-defined normal operation interval.           El comportamiento estructural de las presas de embalse es dif\'icil de predecir con precisi\'on. Los modelos num\'ericos para el c\'alculo estructural resuelven las ecuaciones de la mec\'anica de medios continuos, pero est\'an sujetos a una gran incertidumbre en cuanto a la caracterizaci\'on de los materiales, especialmente en lo que respecta a la cimentaci\'on. Como consecuencia, frecuentemente estos modelos no son capaces de calcular el comportamiento de las presas con suficiente precisi\'on. As\'i, es dif\'icil discernir si un estado que se aleja en cierta medida de la normalidad supone o no una situaci\'on de riesgo estructural. Por el contrario, muchas de las presas en operaci\'on cuentan con un gran n\'umero de aparatos de auscultaci\'on, que registran la evoluci\'on de diversos indicadores como los movimientos, el caudal de filtraci\'on, o la presi\'on intersticial, entre otros. Aunque hoy en d\'ia hay muchas presas con pocos datos observados, hay una tendencia clara hacia la instalaci\'on de un mayor n\'umero de aparatos que registran el comportamiento con mayor frecuencia. Como consecuencia, se tiende a disponer de un volumen creciente de datos que reflejan el comportamiento de la presa, lo cual hace interesante estudiar la capacidad de herramientas desarrolladas en otros campos para extraer informaci\'on \'util a partir de variables observadas. En particular, en el \'ambito del Aprendizaje Autom\'atico (Machine Learning), se han desarrollado algoritmos muy potentes para entender fen\'omenos cuyo mecanismo es poco conocido, acerca de los cuales se dispone de grandes vol\'umenes de datos. En la tesis se ha hecho un an\'alisis de las posibilidades de las t\'ecnicas m\'as recientes de aprendizaje autom\'atico para su aplicaci\'on al an\'alisis estructural de presas basado en los datos de auscultaci\'on. Para ello se han tenido en cuenta las caracter\'isticas habituales de las series de datos disponibles en las presas, en cuanto a su naturaleza, calidad y cantidad. Se ha realizado una revisi\'on cr\'itica de la bibliograf\'ia existente, a partir de la cual se han identificado los aspectos clave a tener en cuenta para implementaci\'on de estos algoritmos en la seguridad de presas. Se ha realizado un estudio comparativo de la precisi\'on de un conjunto de algoritmos para la predicci\'on del comportamiento de presas considerando desplazamientos radiales, tangenciales y filtraciones. Para ello se han utilizado datos reales de una presa b\'oveda. Los resultados sugieren que el algoritmo denominado ``Boosted Regression Trees'' (BRTs) es el m\'as adecuado, por ser m\'as preciso en general, adem\'as de flexible y relativamente f\'acil de implementar. En una etapa posterior, se han identificado las posibilidades de interpretaci\'on del citado algoritmo para extraer la forma e intensidad de la asociaci\'on entre las variables exteriores y la respuesta de la presa, as\'i como el efecto del tiempo. Las herramientas empleadas se han aplicado al mismo caso piloto, y han permitido identificar el efecto del tiempo con m\'as precisi\'on que el m\'etodo estad\'istico tradicional. Finalmente, se ha desarrollado una metodolog\'ia para la aplicaci\'on de modelos de predicci\'on basados en BRTs en la detecci\'on de anomal\'ias en tiempo real. Esta metodolog\'ia se ha implementado en una herramienta inform\'atica interactiva que ofrece informaci\'on sobre el comportamiento de la presa, a trav\'es de un conjunto de aparatos seleccionados. Permite comprobar a simple vista si los datos reales de cada uno de estos aparatos se encuentran dentro del rango de funcionamiento normal de la presa.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the most important information fusion data-driven algorithms based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques for problems in Earth observation. Nowadays we observe and model the Earth with a wealth of observations, from a plethora of different sensors, measuring states, fluxes, processes and variables, at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. Earth observation is well equipped with remote sensing systems, mounted on satellites and airborne platforms, but it also involves in-situ observations, numerical models and social media data streams, among other data sources. Data-driven approaches, and ML techniques in particular, are the natural choice to extract significant information from this data deluge. This paper produces a thorough review of the latest work on information fusion for Earth observation, with a practical intention, not only focusing on describing the most relevant previous works in the field, but also the most important Earth observation applications where ML information fusion has obtained significant results. We also review some of the most currently used data sets, models and sources for Earth observation problems, describing their importance and how to obtain the data whether needed. Finally, we illustrate the application of ML data fusion with a representative set of case studies, as well as we discuss and outlook the near future of the field.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the measurement of dam displacements has benefited from a great improvement of existing technology, which has allowed a higher degree of automation. This has led to data collection with an improved temporal and spatial resolution. Robotic total stations and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) techniques, often in an integrated manner, may provide efficient solutions for measuring 3D displacements on precise locations on the outer surfaces of dams. On the other hand, remote-sensing techniques, such as terrestrial laser scanning, ground-based SAR (synthetic aperture radar) and satellite differential interferometric SAR offer the chance to extend the observed region to a large portion of a structure and its surrounding areas, integrating the information that is usually provided in a limited number of in-situ control points. The design and implementation of integrated monitoring systems have been revealed as a strategic solution to analyze different situations in a spatial and temporal context. Research devoted to the optimization of data processing tools has evolved with the aim of improving the accuracy and reliability of the measured deformations. The analysis of the observed data for the interpretation and prediction of dam deformations under external loads has been largely investigated on the basis of purely statistical or deterministic methods. The latter may integrate observation from geodetic, remote-sensing and geotechnical/structural sensors with mechanical models of the dam structure. In this paper, a review of the available technologies for dam deformation monitoring is provided, including those sensors that are already applied in routinary operations and some experimental solutions. The aim was to support people who are working in this field to have a complete view of existing solutions, as well as to understand future directions and trends.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, major advances have occurred in both understanding and practice with regard to assessment and mitigation of hazard associated with seismically induced soil liquefaction. Soil liquefaction engineering has evolved into a sub-field in its own right, and engineering assessment and mitigation of seismic soil liquefaction hazard is increasingly well addressed in both research and practice. This rapid evolution in the treatment of liquefaction has been pushed largely by a confluence of lessons and data provided by a series of major earthquakes over the past dozen years, as well as by the research and professional/political will engendered by these major seismic events. The overall field of soil liquefaction engineering is now beginning to coalesce into an internally consistent and comprehensive framework, and one in which the various elements are increasingly mutually supportive of each other. Although the rate of progress has been laudable, further advances are occurring, and more remains to be done. As we enter a ``new millenium'', engineers are increasingly well able to deal with important aspects of soil liquefaction engineering. This paper will highlight a number of important recent and ongoing developments in soil liquefaction engineering, and will offer insights regarding research in progress, as well as suggestions regarding further advances needed.},

In the retail industry, customers and their needs are diverse making demand forecasting a challenging task. In this regard, this study aims at developing a three-step data-driven cluster-based demand forecasting approach for the retail industry. First, customers are segmented based on their recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) characteristics. Customers with similar buying behaviors are recognized as a segment, creating an ordered relationship between transactions made by them. In the second step, time-series analysis techniques are used to forecast demand for each customer segment. Finally, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is adopted to ensemble the forecasting results obtained from alternative time series techniques. The applicability of the proposed approach is presented through a comparative case study analysis with presented improvement in the accuracy of daily demand prediction.},

The majority of Iran's plains have subsided in recent years as a result of uncontrolled groundwater extraction, and the Kashan plain is no exception. In this study, ground surface displacement in the Kashan plain region and its impact on the railway were investigated using New Small Baseline Subset (NSBAS) in up-down and east--west directions using descending and ascending Sentinel-1 data collected between 2015 and 2021. Our results indicate that the Kashan plain is subsiding more than 90 mm/year. The study of the local areas around the railway which passes through the study area revealed that the rate of vertical velocity in some locations reaches --23 mm/year, while the rate of east--west velocity is insignificant and is approximately \textpm 2 mm/year. Additionally, a method for analyzing the railway's stability based on longitudinal profiles along the railway is presented. Our findings suggest that more than 60\% of the railway line is subject to variable amounts of subsidence. Additionally, a region of approximately one kilometer of the railway has been classified as a risk zone due to relatively fast local deformation. After examining the effect of various factors, it was determined that uncontrolled groundwater extraction in agricultural areas contributed to the subsidence in this area. Our results show that the presented stability control approach in this study is highly reliable for creating hazard profiles for linear structures, such as railways.},

Meanwhile, the applicability of diverse machine learning algorithms in settling specific geotechnical engineering issues is compared. The main findings are as follows: ANN, SVM, and DT have been widely adopted to solve a variety of geotechnical engineering issues, such as the classification of soil and rock types, predicting the properties of geotechnical materials, etc. Based on the collected relevant research, the performance of random forest (RF) in sorting soil types and assessing landslide susceptibility is satisfying; SVM has high precision in classifying rock types and forecasting rock deformation; and backpropagation ANNs and Hopfield ANNs are recommended to forecast rock compressive strength and soil settlement, respectively.},

Solutions that are efficient for specific hardware architectures can not be used in other environments. Packages that work on generic hardware and open standards will not have the same performance as dedicated solutions. Software that assumes that its users are computer programmers are flexible but may be difficult to learn for a wide audience. This paper describes sits, an open-source R package for satellite image time series analysis using machine learning. To allow experts to use satellite imagery to the fullest extent, sits adopts a time-first, space-later approach. It supports the complete cycle of data analysis for land classification. Its API provides a simple but powerful set of functions. The software works in different cloud computing environments. Satellite image time series are input to machine learning classifiers, and the results are post-processed using spatial smoothing. Since machine learning methods need accurate training data, sits includes methods for quality assessment of training samples. The software also provides methods for validation and accuracy measurement. The package thus comprises a production environment for big EO data analysis. We show that this approach produces high accuracy for land use and land cover maps through a case study in the Cerrado biome, one of the world's fast moving agricultural frontiers for the year 2018.},

  abstract = {Geological disasters are responsible for the loss of human lives and for significant economic and financial damage every year. Considering that these disasters may occur anywhere---both in remote and/or in highly populated areas---and anytime, continuously monitoring areas known to be more prone to geohazards can help to determine preventive or alert actions to safeguard human life, property and businesses. Remote sensing technology---especially satellite-based---can be of help due to its high spatial and temporal coverage. Indeed, data acquired from the most recent satellite missions is considered suitable for a detailed reconstruction of past events but also to continuously monitor sensitive areas on the lookout for potential geohazards. This work aims to apply different techniques and methods for extensive exploitation and analysis of remote sensing data, with special emphasis given to landslide hazard, risk management and disaster prevention. Multi-temporal SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) interferometry, SAR tomography, high-resolution image matching and data modelling are used to map out landslides and other geohazards and to also monitor possible hazardous geological activity, addressing different study areas: (i) surface deformation of mountain slopes and glaciers; (ii) land surface displacement; and (iii) subsidence, landslides and ground fissure. Results from both the processing and analysis of a dataset of earth observation (EO) multi-source data support the conclusion that geohazards can be identified, studied and monitored in an effective way using new techniques applied to multi-source EO data. As future work, the aim is threefold: extend this study to sensitive areas located in different countries; monitor structures that have strategic, cultural and/or economical relevance; and resort to artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to be able to analyse the huge amount of data generated by satellite missions and extract useful information in due course.},

  abstract = {Measurements of concrete dam displacements are influenced by various factors such as hydrostatic load, thermal effect and irreversible phenomena (creep, swelling, etc.). To interpret measurements and improve the assessment of irreversible effects, splitting the different influences is necessary. For this purpose, models based on statistics and physics are commonly employed in engineering studies. Although they are efficient in most cases to analyse the displacement of concrete dams, these models are built on a certain number of hypotheses, necessary to write ``simple'' mathematical relationships, but leading to uncertainties. To evaluate the suitability of these physico-statistical models (importance of the hypotheses) and to improve it, a 2D finite element (FE) model has been developed as a heuristic case. This study shows the importance of water temperature and temperature gradient in the assessment of the thermal displacements. So, a new physico-statistical model is proposed to account for these phenomena. The evaluation of its performance on both the FE heuristic case and real cases shows that the improved assessment of thermal effects on reversible phenomena leads to a reduced uncertainty on residuals. Thus, the proposed approach yields to a better assessment of irreversible trends.},

  abstract = {Several factors are acting on concrete dams and affect dam displacements: hydrostatic load, thermal effect and irreversible phenomena (creep, swelling \dots ). The different influences need to be quantified for the analysis of monitoring measurements. In most statistical models for the dam behavior analysis, the thermal effect which is often the main contributor to the total displacement is introduced only by means of the dam temperatures. Recently Tatin et al. (2015) have introduced a global gradient across the dam of the temperature bringing an additional bending effect. However, the thermal gradient may be very different, even with opposite sign, from the top to the bottom depending on seasons.},

ML techniques, including deep learning methods, are becoming popular to model complex landslide problems and are starting to demonstrate promising predictive performance compared to conventional methods. Almost all the studies published in the literature in recent years belong to one of the following three broad categories: landslide detection and mapping, landslide spatial forecasting in the form of susceptibility mapping, and landslide temporal forecasting. In this paper, we present a brief overview of ML techniques, provide a general summary of the landslide studies conducted, in recent years, in the three above-mentioned categories, and make an attempt to critically evaluate the use of ML methods to model landslide processes. The paper also provides suggestions for future use of these powerful data-driven techniques in landslide studies.},

  abstract = {This paper submits a report on the effective adoption of machine learning algorithms for enhancing the reliability of rainfall-induced landslides. The challenges involved in the design of reliable landslide early warning systems (LEWS) and the datadriven context for overcoming these challenges have been presented. The operation of LEWS is explained using the chain of five major components (i) Data collection, (ii) Data transmission, (iii) Modelling, analysis and forecasting, (iv) Warning, and (v) Response. Failure of any of these major components of the LEWS will break the chain of operation of LEWS and the ensued consequences of each component failure are reviewed. Inferences drawn from the analysis of the reliability measures incorporated in 12 LEWS deployments across a dozen locations around the world are also presented. Based on the investigations from 12 LEWS and the real-world experience, we identified that an alternate solution is required for ensuring the reliability of LEWS, especially during disaster scenarios when warnings are crucial, but data availability is a constraint. We recognized that machine learning algorithms can provide an alternate solution and in this paper, we have discussed two machine learning approaches nowcasting and forecasting for enhancing the reliability. Both the algorithms employ historic data of the landslide monitoring parameters to learn the changes materializing in slope leading to landslide incidences. The learned knowledge is used to nowcast and forecast the real-time and future conditions of the slope from the real-time landslide monitoring parameters. In terms of ensuring reliability, (i) Nowcasting algorithm provides an alternate solution if either the Data collection component or Data transmission component of a LEWS fails. (ii) Forecasting algorithm provides extra lead-time for early warning and solves the problem of less lead-time during early warning process. The breakthrough is even when the realtime landslide monitoring parameters are not available for various reasons, these algorithms take the minimal input of rainfall forecast information for nowcasting and forecasting thus restoring the broken chain of operation of LEWS.},

We processed LiCSAR interferograms using the SBAS tool, and we obtained average displacement maps for the period 2016--2021. We found that the maximum displacement rate of each landslide is located at about the center of it. The average E-W velocity of the Krini landslide is \textasciitilde 3 cm/year (toward the east) and 0.6 cm/year downward. The line-of-sight (LOS) velocity of the landslide (descending orbit) compares well to a co-located GNSS station within (\textpm ) 3 mm/yr. Our results also suggest a correlation between rainfall and landslide motion. For the Krini landslide, a cross-correlation analysis of our data suggests that the mean time lag was 13.5 days between the maximum seasonal rainfall and the change in the LOS displacement rate. We also found that the amount of total seasonal rainfall controls the increase in the displacement rate, as 40--550\% changes in the displacement rate of the Krini landslide were detected, following to a seasonal maximum of rainfall values at the nearby meteorological station of Kato Vlassia. According to our results, it seems that large part of this mountainous region of Achaia suffers from slope instability that is manifested in various degrees of ground displacement greatly affecting its morphological features and inhabited areas.},

Detecting active landslides and ascertaining their impact necessitate the determination of deformation characteristics. In this study, we developed an integrated method combining interferometric synthetic aperture radar and high-resolution optical satellite remote sensing to detect active landslides in the Upper Yellow River region from Longyang Gorge to Lijia Gorge. Sentinel-1 satellite data from January 2019 to April 2021 with ascending and descending orbits were adopted to obtain deformation using the STACKING and interferometric point target analysis techniques. A 97.08\% overlap rate in the detected results from the two InSAR technologies confirmed the suitability of both approaches. The missing detection rates (6.79\% \& 8.73\%) from single line-of-sight (LOS) InSAR results indicate the necessity of different orbit direction data. Slight deformation rate changes ({$<$}4 mm/month) before and after rainy seasons of the Lijia Gorge landslide group indicate that precipitation exerted little impact on slope activity. This study supports the feasibility of integrated methods for the detection and analysis of active landslides in the Upper Yellow River and other regions.},

The ground deformation in this paper appeared in the city's development, although it is close to the Erhai region, which is different from a water-deficient city. Therefore, the analysis and prediction of ground deformation using a new method is required. In this study, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from 2015 to 2018 were used to study the characteristics of ground deformation in the Erhai region using the Small Baseline Subset Interferometric SAR (SBAS-InSAR) technique. The results were cross-validated using ascending and descending direction images to ensure the accuracy. In addition, the results showed that there was little ground deformation in the northern part of the Erhai region, while there was obvious ground deformation in the southern part. Four influencing factors---including the building area, water level, cumulative precipitation, and cumulative temperature of the southern Erhai region---were used together to predict the cumulative ground deformation using back-propagation (BP). The R of all the involved data was 0.966, and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the simulated values using BP and the true measured values were 3.063, 1.003, and 1.119, respectively. The results showed that BP has great potential in predicting the change tendency of ground deformation with high precision. The main reason for ground deformation is the continuous increase of building area; the water level followed. The cumulative precipitation and cumulative temperature are the reasons for the seasonal ground deformation. Some countermeasures and suggestions are given to face the challenge of serious ground deformation.},

This paper proposes a novel machinelearning and deep-learning method to identify natural-terrain landslides using integrated geodatabases. First, landslide-related data are compiled, including topographic data, geological data and rainfall-related data. Then, three integrated geodatabases are established; namely, Recent Landslide Database (RecLD), Relict Landslide Database (RelLD) and Joint Landslide Database (JLD). After that, five machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), boosting methods and convolutional neural network (CNN), are utilized and evaluated on each database. A case study in Lantau, Hong Kong, is conducted to demonstrate the application of the proposed method. From the results of the case study, CNN achieves an identification accuracy of 92.5\% on RecLD, and outperforms other algorithms due to its strengths in feature extraction and multi dimensional data processing. Boosting methods come second in terms of accuracy, followed by RF, LR and SVM. By using machine learning and deep learning techniques, the proposed landslide identification method shows outstanding robustness and great potential in tackling the landslide identification problem.},

However, the traditional landslide early warning mainly makes decisions through thresholds, and if the thresholds are not selected properly, it will lead to missing alarms and false alarms frequently. To resolve this problem, this study proposes a landslide early warning algorithm based on a K-meansResNet model. This method uses the K-means method to cluster the landslide deformation state, and then uses ResNet to classify the landslide rainfall and deformation data, so as to realize the threshold-free judgment and early warning of landslide deformation state. The model was applied to the Zhongma landslide, Guangxi Province, China, and the Shangmao landslide, Hunan Province, China, for validation and evaluation. The results showed that the accuracy, precision and recall of the proposed model can reach 0.975, 0.938, 0.863 and 0.993, 0.993, 0.925, respectively, for classifying the deformation states of the two landslides, and the classification results are better than those of the baseline model. Compared with the threshold-based early warning method, the proposed early warning method does not require artificial determination of threshold parameters and can effectively identify landslide deformation states, which can not only reduce false alarms and missing alarms but also improve the reliability of early warning.},

  abstract = {Monitoring dam deformation and reservoir conditions plays an important role in routine dam safety assessment. However, maintaining a real-time dam monitoring system and conducting frequent site surveys come with high costs, which may hinder the detection and mitigation of potentially hazardous dam conditions or incident in\- vestigations. In view of inaccessibility of in situ data for the scientific community and the need for rapid dam failure hazard investigation, we propose an end-to-end framework that relies on multiple and open-source remote sensing data for the dam-related hazard investigation (RSDHI). The proposed RSDHI framework in\- cludes three modules that are capable of monitoring the post-construction deformation status of the dam and the reservoir and provide the first-order and quantitative examination of the hazard causality based on numerical models. We apply and validate the RSDHI framework to a case study of the 2020 Sardoba dam failure in Uzbekistan. We show that the Sardoba Dam experienced continuing subsidence and a local \textasciitilde{} 4.7 cm differential settlement near the breached section. We reveal that the secondary consolidation controls post-construction deformation. The failure was likely related to the compound effect of transverse structural cracks that resulted from the differential settlement and water loading, yet the exact reason for its failure remains unknown. This study demonstrates that the RSDHI framework can combine multi-sensor remote sensing observations and nu\- merical modeling to provide a complete and up-to-date status report of dam conditions, thereby providing in\- sights into potential instability of dams around the world and enabling rapid investigation of their failures even when no in situ data is available.},

Time-series displacement data of slopes directly reflect the deformation characteristics and stability properties of slopes. The use of existing data analysis approaches, such as statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, to establish a reasonable and accurate prediction model based on the monitored time-series displacement data is a common solution to slope deformation prediction. In this paper, we conduct a comparative investigation of machine learning approaches for slope deformation prediction based on monitored time-series displacement data. First, we established eleven slope deformation prediction models based on the time-series displacement data obtained from seven in situ monitoring points of the Huanglianshu landslide using machine learning approaches. Second, four evaluation metrics were used to comparatively analyze the prediction performance of all models at each monitoring point. The experimental results of the Huanglianshu landslide indicated that the long-short-term memory (LSTM) model with an attention mechanism and the transformer model achieved the highest prediction accuracy. The comparative analysis of model characteristics suggested that the Transformer model is better adapted to predict nonlinear landslide displacements that are affected by multiple factors. The drawn conclusion could help select a suitable slope deformation model for early landslide warnings.},

The dam safety monitoring data is time-series data with both trend and seasonality. In order to obtain more accurate prediction results, this paper proposes a prediction model based on ARIMA-LSTM, which solves the problem that the single prediction algorithm cannot solve the linear component and the nonlinear component in the dam deformation data at the same time. The model uses Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to predict linear components in deformation data, and uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict nonlinear components in dam deformation data. Combined with the dam monitoring data of Manwan Hydropower Station, we use the ARIMA-LSTM model to predict the future sequence and compared with the predicted results of ARIMA model, LSTM model and traditional-combined model. We found that the model has the smallest RMSE value and the FA value of this model is closest to 1. The results proved that the model can improve the accuracy of prediction effectively.},

  abstract = {The Heifangtai Loess terrace in northwest China is frequently affected by landslides due to hydrological factors, establishing it as a significant research area for loess landslides. Advanced time-series InSAR technology facilitates the retrieval of surface deformation information, thereby aiding in the monitoring of landslide deformation status. However, existing methods that analyze deformation patterns do not fully exploit the displacement time series derived from InSAR, which hampers the exploration of potentially coexisting deformation patterns within the area. This study integrates InSAR with time-series clustering methods to reveal the surface deformation patterns and their spatial distribution characteristics in Heifangtai. Initially, utilizing the Sentinel-1 ascending and descending SAR data stack from January 2020 to June 2023, we optimize the interferometric phase based on distributed scatterer characteristics to reduce noise levels and obtain higher spatial density of measurement points. Subsequently, by combining the differential interferometric datasets from both ascending and descending orbits, the multidimensional small baseline subsets technique is employed to calculate the two-dimensional deformation time series. Finally, time-series clustering methods are utilized to extract the deformation patterns present and their spatial distribution from all measurement point time series. The results indicate that the deformation of the Heifangtai is primarily distributed around the surrounding area of the platform, with subsidence deformation being more intense than horizontal deformation. The entire terrace exhibits five deformation patterns: eastward subsidence, westward subsidence, vertical subsidence, westward movement, and eastward movement. The spatial distribution of these patterns suggests that the areas beneath the platform, namely Yanguoxia Town and Dangchuan Village, may be more susceptible to landslide threats in the future. Furthermore, wavelet analysis reveals the response relationship between rainfall and various deformation patterns, further enhancing the interpretability of these patterns. These findings hold significant implications for subsequent landslide monitoring, early warning, and risk prevention.},

Although much progress has been made with remote sensing technologies and their applications in China, there is no systematical summary report. Thus, we summarize Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), optical remote sensing, and laser technologies currently being used in China, and their associated platforms (space-borne, air-borne, and ground-based). Multi-temporal optical images and time series SAR are often used to detect active landslides at time scales of years and months. The latest optical images and SAR intensity images are usual adopted to map fresh landslides, especial for coseismic landslides. LiDAR technology has been widely applied to identify ancient landslides. Combining advantages and limitations of every technology, an integrated space-air-ground collaborative investigation strategy has been proposed for early identification and early warning of landslides. Additionally, a comprehensive landslide investigation integrating multidisciplinary approaches, including remote sensing, geology, and geophysical exploration, could be a further developing trend, because remote sensing technologies just provide surface information, while a complete understanding of landslides requires more than surface information -- knowledge of geotechnical pa\- rameters, geological features, and field conditions is also needed.},

ANN, ML, DL, and EL models have found extensive application in predicting geotechnical and geoenvironmental parameters. This research aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the applications of ANN, ML, DL, and EL in addressing forecasting within the field related to geotechnical engineering, including soil mechanics, foundation engineering, rock mechanics, environmental geotechnics, and transportation geotechnics. Previous studies have not collectively examined all four algorithms---ANN, ML, DL, and EL---and have not explored their advantages and disadvantages in the field of geotechnical engineering. This research aims to categorize and address this gap in the existing literature systematically. An extensive dataset of relevant research studies was gathered from the Web of Science and subjected to an analysis based on their approach, primary focus and objectives, year of publication, geographical distribution, and results. Additionally, this study included a co-occurrence keyword analysis that covered ANN, ML, DL, and EL techniques, systematic reviews, geotechnical engineering, and review articles that the data, sourced from the Scopus database through the Elsevier Journal, were then visualized using VOS Viewer for further examination. The results demonstrated that ANN is widely utilized despite the proven potential of ML, DL, and EL methods in geotechnical engineering due to the need for real-world laboratory data that civil and geotechnical engineers often encounter. However, when it comes to predicting behavior in geotechnical scenarios, EL techniques outperform all three other methods. Additionally, the techniques discussed here assist geotechnical engineering in understanding the benefits and disadvantages of ANN, ML, DL, and EL within the geo techniques area. This understanding enables geotechnical practitioners to select the most suitable techniques for creating a certainty and resilient ecosystem.},

Among the factors to maintain sustainability is to maintain and manage the water assets in dams. Water asset management in dams includes a process to ensure the planned maintenance can be conducted and assets such as pipes, pumps and motors can be mended, substituted, or upgraded when needed within the allocated budgetary. Nowadays, most water asset management systems collect and process data for data analysis and decision-making. Machine learning (ML) is an emerging concept applied to fulfill the requirement in engineering applications such as dam water researches. ML can analyze vast volumes of data and through an ML model built from algorithms, ML can learn, recognize and produce accurate results and analysis. The result brings meaningful insights for water asset management specifically to strategize the optimal solution based on the forecast or prediction. For example, a preventive maintenance for replacing water assets according to the prediction from the ML model. We will discuss the approaches of machine learning in recent dam water research and review the emerging issues to manage water assets in dams in this paper.},

  abstract = {An efficient method of landslide detection can provide basic scientific data for emergency command and landslide susceptibility mapping. Compared to a traditional landslide detection approach, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been proven to have powerful capabilities in reducing the time consumed for selecting the appropriate features for landslides. Currently, the success of transformers in natural language processing (NLP) demonstrates the strength of selfattention in global semantic information acquisition. How to effectively integrate transformers into CNN, alleviate the limitation of the receptive field, and improve the model generation are hot topics in remote sensing image processing based on deep learning (DL). Inspired by the vision transformer (ViT), this paper first attempts to integrate a transformer into ResU-Net for landslide detection tasks with small datasets, aiming to enhance the network ability in modelling the global context of feature maps and drive the model to recognize landslides with a small dataset. Besides, a spatial and channel attention module was introduced into the decoder to effectually suppress the noise in the feature maps from the convolution and transformer. By selecting two landslide datasets with different geological characteristics, the feasibility of the proposed model was validated. Finally, the standard ResU-Net was chosen as the benchmark to evaluate the proposed model rationality. The results indicated that the proposed model obtained the highest mIoU and F1-score in both datasets, demonstrating that the ResU-Net with a transformer embedded can be used as a robust landslide detection method and thus realize the generation of accurate regional landslide inventory and emergency rescue.},

The Muyubao landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir area in China was taken as a case study. A total of 37 images from March 2016 to September 2017 were collected, and the displacement time series were extracted using the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterer (StaMPS) small baselines subset method. The comparison to global positioning system monitoring results indicated that the InSAR processing of the Muyubao landslide was accurate and reliable. Combined with the field investigation, the deformation evolution and its response to triggering factors were analyzed. During this monitoring period, the creeping process of the Muyubao landslide showed obvious spatiotemporal deformation differences. The changes in the reservoir water level were the trigger of the Muyubao landslide, and its deformation mainly occurred during the fluctuation period and high-water level period of the reservoir.},

  abstract = {In recent years, due to adverse geological conditions, intense human engineering activities, and extreme weather conditions, catastrophic landslides have frequently occurred in southwest China, causing severe loss of life and property. Identifying the kinematic features of potential landslides can effectively support landslide hazard prevention. This study proposes a remote sensing identification method for rotational, planar traction, and planar thrust slides based on geomorphic features as well as vertical and slope-oriented deformation rates. Rotational landslides are characterized by similar vertical and horizontal deformation rates, with vertical deformation mainly occurring at the head and gradually decreasing along the slope, while horizontal deformation mainly occurs at the foot and gradually increases along the slope. As for the planar slide, the dominant deformation is in the horizontal direction. It is further classified into the planar traction and planar thrust types according to the driving position. The vertical deformation of planar traction slides is concentrated at the foot, while the vertical deformation of planar thrust slides is concentrated at the head of the landslide. We identified 1 rotational landslide, 10 planar traction landslides and 10 planar thrust landslides in the basalt weathering crust area of Guizhou. Field investigations of three landslides verified the method's accuracy. Combining two-dimensional rainfall and time-series deformations, we found that there is a significant positive correlation between landslide deformation acceleration and precipitation. The landslide kinematic identification method proposed in this paper overcomes the shortcomings of the inability to accurately characterize landslide motion by line-of-sight displacement and realizes the non-contact identification of active landslide motion patterns, which is an essential reference value for geological disaster prevention and control in the study area.},

  abstract = {Cascading landslides are specific multi-hazard events in which a primary movement triggers successive landslide processes. Areas with dynamic and quickly changing environments are more prone to this type of phenomena. Both the kind and the evolution velocity of a landslide depends on the materials involved. Indeed, rockfalls are generated when rocks fall from a very steep slope, while debris flow and/or mudslides are generated by fine materials like silt and clay after strong water imbibition. These events can amplify the damage caused by the initial trigger and propagate instability along a slope, often resulting in significant environmental and societal impacts. The Morino-Rendinara cascading landslide, situated in the Ernici Mountains along the border of the Abruzzo and Lazio regions (Italy), serves as a notable example of the complexities and devastating consequences associated with such events. In March 2021, a substantial debris flow event obstructed the Liri River, marking the latest step in a series of landslide events. Conventional techniques such as geomorphological observations and geological surveys may not provide exhaustive information to explain the landslide phenomena in progress. For this reason, UAV image acquisition, InSAR interferometry, and pixel offset analysis can be used to improve the knowledge of the mechanism and kinematics of landslide events. In this work, the interferometric data ranged from 3 January 2020 to 24 March 2023, while the pixel offset data covered the period from 2016 to 2022. The choice of such an extensive data window provided comprehensive insight into the investigated events, including the possibility of identifying other unrecorded events and aiding in the development of more effective mitigation strategies. Furthermore, to supplement the analysis, a specific finite element method for slope stability analysis was used to reconstruct the deep geometry of the system, emphasizing the effect of groundwater-level flow on slope stability. All of the findings indicate that major landslide activities were concentrated during the heavy rainfall season, with movements ranging from several centimeters per year. These results were consistent with numerical analyses, which showed that the potential slip surface became significantly more unstable when the water table was elevated.},
