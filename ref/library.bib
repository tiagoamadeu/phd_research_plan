	abstract = {The determination of displacement warning thresholds is a difficult and crucial task for landslide early warning, as it requires a deep understanding of displacement monitoring curve patterns and significantly impacts the effectiveness of natural hazard mitigation efforts. In recent years, the emergence of advanced technologies such as the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar has enabled largescale monitoring of landslide surface displacement, while also introducing new challenges in establishing displacement warning thresholds. While displacement monitoring curves exhibit various patterns in large-region monitoring environments, the conventional Saito method assumes a landslide deformation trend of three creep stages and cannot achieve ideal early warning results. Consequently, this study is conducted based on an analysis of a GNSS surface displacement curve database built by the China Institute of Geological Environmental Monitoring. An identification method for identifying landslide deformation stages is developed based on the idea of morphology, leading to the creation of a big data source of landslide deformation stages. The spatial distri­ bution of these deformation stages within the data source serves as the foundation for developing a technique for identifying deformation thresholds and a corresponding multilevel early warning method. The early warning performance is validated using long-duration displacement monitoring curves, and the spatiotemporal distri­ bution characteristics of the deformation stages are discussed. This study can provides valuable insights for displacement monitoring, early warning, and hazard prevention of large-scale landslides.},

	abstract = {Analyzing and quantifying the deformation process of landslides is of paramount importance in facilitating landslide early warning. As such, this study is committed to proposing a universal phenomenological model for deformation stages division and early warning of landslides based on the kinematic features. First, five landslide deformation patterns were classified based on the creep theory, and suggestions for stage division of each deformation pattern are presented. Then, the statistical characteristics of landslide velocity were analyzed, and a probability-based deformation stage division method was proposed. Finally, the Comprehensive Standardized Deformation Index (CSDI) model, which includes the calculation of the CSDIM−M (Min-Max normalization) and CSDIM (Mean normalization) was proposed and verified in 24 landslides worldwide. The results show that, except for the oscillating pattern, the CSDIM−M is feasible in the stages division of all deformation patterns with a strong correspondence with the actual state of the landslides. The CSDIM is a reliable landslide warning criterion and threshold determination method, as it is effective in the early warning of imminent landslides with a low false alarm rate. The CSDI model provides new insight into the division of landslide deformation stages and landslide risk assessment.},

First, we use InSAR for the detection of active slope movements during the study period (October 2019 to January 2021). Then, we characterize the displacement rates and their variation through time for selected active slopes, by analysing 6-days interferograms. The evolutionary trends of the phenomena are compared to the pertaining climate and soil parameters that are used by the regional landslide early warning system (LEWS) to predict the possibility of landslide occurrence over the territory. We aim to explore the potential of differential interferometry to detect and monitor active landslides and, through that, to validate a geographical LEWS: Through the analysis of stacked interferograms, we identified 256 InSAR deformation signals (IDS) corre­ sponding to active slope movements. Their distribution is compared to the geological map and the landslide inventory, illustrating how active landslides are favoured by weak lithologies and pre-existing slope instability. Also, the relative orientation of the satellite’s line of sight with respect to the slope influences the results indi­ cating a bias in the completeness of remotely sensed data. However, in the context of land management and civil protection, the results constitute a valuable information dataset for plans managed by local authorities.},

	abstract = {The management of unstable slopes is one of the most critical issues when dealing with safety in open-pit mines. Suitable notice of impending failure events must be provided, and at the same time the number of false alarms must be kept to a minimum to avoid ﬁnancial losses deriving from unnecessary outages of the production works. Comprehensive slope monitoring programs and early warning systems are usually implemented to this aim. However, systematic procedures for their tuning are lacking and several key factors are often overlooked. Therefore the mitigation of slope failure risk is still a topic of great concern, especially in open-pit mines excavated through hard rock masses featuring markedly brittle behavior, which supposedly provide little or no measurable precursors to failure. In this paper, 9 instabilities occurred at an undisclosed open-pit mine, and monitored by ground-based radar devices, were reviewed with the goal of characterizing the typical slope deformation behavior and deﬁning the appropriate strategy for the setup of alarms. The estimated mass of the case studies ranged from 1500 t to 750,000 t. 5 instabilities culminated to failure, whereas the other 4, although showing considerable amounts and rates of movement, ultimately did not fail. The analysis provided critical insights into the deformation of hard rock masses of high geomechanical quality, and allowed the identiﬁcation of “signature” parameters of the failure events. General operative recommendations for eﬀective slope monitoring and early warning were consequently derived.},

	abstract = {Predicting the time of failure is a topic of major concern in the field of geological risk management. Several approaches, based on the analysis of displacement monitoring data, have been proposed in recent years to deal with the issue. Among these, the inverse velocity method surely demonstrated its effectiveness in anticipating the time of collapse of rock slopes displaying accelerating trends of deformation rate. However, inferring suitable linear trend lines and deducing reliable failure predictions from inverse velocity plots are processes that may be hampered by the noise present in the measurements; data smoothing is therefore a very important phase of inverse velocity analyses. In this study, different filters are tested on velocity time series from four case studies of geomechanical failure in order to improve, in retrospect, the reliability of failure predictions: Specifically, three major landslides and the collapse of an historical city wall in Italy have been examined. The effects of noise on the interpretation of inverse velocity graphs are also assessed. General guidelines to conveniently perform data smoothing, in relation to the specific characteristics of the acceleration phase, are deduced. Finally, with the aim of improving the practical use of the method and supporting the definition of emergency response plans, some standard procedures to automatically setup failure alarm levels are proposed. The thresholds which separate the alarm levels would be established without needing a long period of neither reference historical data nor calibration on past failure events.},

The landslide has been moving slowly for over 40 years, requiring regular maintenance work along where a highway and a railway track cross the sliding mass. Since 2013, the landslide has shown signs of retrogression. Monitoring prisms were installed on a retaining wall immediately downslope from the railway alignment to monitor the evolution of the retrogression. As of September 2016, cumulative displacements in the horizontal direction approached 4.5 m in the central section of the railway retaining wall. After an initial phase of acceleration, horizontal velocities showed a steadier trend between 3 and 9 mm/day, which was then followed by a second acceleration phase. This paper presents an analysis of the characteristics of the surface displacement vectors measured at the monitoring prisms. Critical insight on the behavior and kinematics of the 10-mile Slide retrogression was gained. An advanced analysis of the trends of inverse velocity plots was also performed to assess the potential for a slope collapse at the 10-mile Slide and to obtain further knowledge on the nature of the sliding surface.},

Here we present the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS) technique on satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data to assess the course of events. We find that parts of the dam wall and tailings were experiencing deformation not consistent with consolidation settlement preceding the collapse. Furthermore, we show that the timing of the dam collapse would have been foreseeable based on this observed precursory deformation. We conclude that satellite-based monitoring techniques may help mitigate similar catastrophes in the future.},

In Pakistan, Abbottabad city in particular is experiencing fast urban growth. The main source of daily water usage for the population in these types of cities is groundwater (tube–wells). Excessive pumping and the high need for ground water for the local community are affecting the subsurface sustainability. In this study, the persistent scatterer interferometry synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR) technique with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired from the Sentinel-1 were used to monitor ground subsidence in Abbottabad City, Northern Pakistan. To estimate the ground subsidence in Abbottabad City, SARPROZ software was employed to process a series of Sentinel-1 images, acquired from March 2017 to September 2019, along both descending and ascending orbit tracks. The subsidence observed in the results shows a signiﬁcant increase from 2017 to 2019. The subsidence map shows that, during 2017, the subsidence was −30 mm/year and about −85 mm/year in 2018. While during 2019, the subsidence reached −150 mm/year. Thus, it has seen that, in the study area, the subsidence during these years increased with mean subsidence 60 mm/year. The overall trend of subsidence showed considerably high values in the center of the city, while areas away from the center of the city experienced low subsidence. Overall, the adopted methodology can be used successfully for detecting, mapping, and monitoring land surfaces vulnerable to subsidence. This will facilitate efﬁcient planning, designing of surface infrastructure, and mitigation management of subsidence-induced hazards.},

	abstract = {Ground subsidence in urban areas is a significant problem because it increases flood risk, damages buildings and infrastructure, and results in economic loss. Continual monitoring of ground deformation is important for early detection, mechanism understanding, countermeasure implementation, and deformation prediction. The Sentinel-1 satellite constellation has globally and freely provided frequent and abundant SAR data and enabled nationwide deformation monitoring through InSAR time series analysis. LiCSAR, an automatic Sentinel-1 interferometric processing system, has produced abundant interferograms with global coverage, and the products are freely accessible and downloadable through a web portal. LiCSBAS, an open source InSAR time series analysis package integrated with LiCSAR, enables users to obtain the deformation time series easily and quickly. In this study, spatially and temporally detailed deformation time series and velocities from the LiCSAR products using LiCSBAS for 73 major urban areas in Japan during 2014–2020 were derived. All LiCSBAS processing was automatically performed using predefined parameters. Many deformation signals with various temporal and spatial features, such as linear subsidence in Hirosaki, Kujyukuri, Niigata, and Kanazawa, episodic subsidence in Sanjo, annual vertical fluctuation in Hirosaki, Yamagata, Yonezawa, Ojiya, and Nogi, and linear uplift in Chofu were detected. Unknown small nonlinear uplift signals were found in Nara and Osaka in 2018. Complex postseismic deformations from the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake were also revealed. All the deformation data obtained in this study are available on an open repository and are expected to be used for further research, investigation, or interpretation. This nationwide monitoring approach using the LiCSAR products and LiCSBAS is easy to implement and applicable to other areas worldwide.},

	abstract = {The construction of underground tunnels can prime or trigger ground subsidence, and thus surface deformation monitoring is required during and post-construction. Freely available satellite data allow significant possibilities for the use of remote sensing techniques, particularly multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (Mt-InSAR), for surface deformation monitoring. However, track records and field demonstrations of InSARbased tunneling-related deformation monitoring are limited, particularly in identifying the spatiotemporal evolution of ground deformation and causal factors thereof from construction activities. Therefore, this study explores the feasibility of using satellite SAR data to monitor the surface deformation associated with different tunnel construction phases. Tunneling-related surface deformation was analyzed using the persistent scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) technique and Sentinel-1B SAR data; the PS-InSAR results were compared with those from the conventional leveling method. The velocity map of the study site revealed a localized subsidence trough asso­ ciated with the construction of vertical shafts and shield tunneling. The cumulative time-series displacement map successfully tracked the spatial and temporal progression of ground deformations related to the phases of tunnel construction activities. The maximum subsidence rate in the radar line-of-sight direction was estimated to exceed 40 mm/yr, with maximum cumulative subsidence of {\textasciitilde} 200 mm. The results clearly showed that dewatering during tunneling aggravated the subsidence phenomenon. The consequent compaction and consolidation of the compressible soil layers due to the lowered groundwater table were the main causes of subsidence. Our results demonstrate the viability of the PS-InSAR technique based on the C-band Sentinel-1 product as a monitoring method to examine the spatiotemporal evolution of ground deformation patterns during tunneling activities and as a possible preliminary surveying tool to identify ongoing abnormal settlement prior to tunnel construction.},

The exact date of failure was obtained based on a photographic monitoring performed every 4 h. The long-term monitoring (2,217 days) of the rock slope carried out by a Terrestrial LiDAR allowed the early detection of both pre-failure deformation and precursory rockfalls preceding the final failure. By means of the analysis of the pre-failure deformation, four different deformed areas were detected and the tertiary creep phase was observed in three of them. An attempt to predict the time to failure was performed using the Fukuzono’s (1985) method. Furthermore, the temporal evolution of the precursory rockfalls occurred in those four areas during the progressive failure showed a close resemblance with the exponential pattern of the cumulated displacements at tertiary creep stage. Finally, the study of the meteorological conditions did not show any single triggering factor associated with the final failure. Reversely, the increase in the occurrence of precursory rockfalls on several areas of the slope together with the observed acceleration on the deformation pattern reinforce the role of a progressive degradation of the stability conditions, which ultimately leaded to the 3 December rockfall event.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive methodological framework for structural deformation monitoring of critical infrastructure assets based on differential SAR interferometry. By employing persistent scatterer interferometry, deformation time series in line-of-sight are derived from freely available Sentinel-1 single look complex products. These raw time series are analysed and refined using an extensive post-processing chain to obtain daily rates for vertical and horizontal deformation components. The post-processing includes cleaning, smoothing and a tem­ perature correction to account for different sensing times in ascending and descending orbits. Longitudinal clustering of time series is used to reveal spatial patterns in the single epoch deformation series. Seasonal trend decomposition of the aggregated time series is performed to separate deformation trends from seasonal de­ formations. The applicability of the framework is showcased at the example of an integral concrete bridge located in the port of Vienna. Results are validated against in situ deformation measurements. The presented framework constitutes a blueprint for the continuous monitoring of critical infrastructure assets using satellite interferometry, which may supplement conventional structural health monitoring.},

	abstract = {Landslide early warning is a key technology for effective landslide prevention and control. However, the traditional landslide early warning mainly makes decisions through thresholds, and if the thresholds are not selected properly, it will lead to missing alarms and false alarms frequently. To resolve this problem, this study proposes a landslide early warning algorithm based on a K-meansResNet model. This method uses the K-means method to cluster the landslide deformation state, and then uses ResNet to classify the landslide rainfall and deformation data, so as to realize the threshold-free judgment and early warning of landslide deformation state. The model was applied to the Zhongma landslide, Guangxi Province, China, and the Shangmao landslide, Hunan Province, China, for validation and evaluation. The results showed that the accuracy, precision and recall of the proposed model can reach 0.975, 0.938, 0.863 and 0.993, 0.993, 0.925, respectively, for classifying the deformation states of the two landslides, and the classiﬁcation results are better than those of the baseline model. Compared with the threshold-based early warning method, the proposed early warning method does not require artiﬁcial determination of threshold parameters and can effectively identify landslide deformation states, which can not only reduce false alarms and missing alarms but also improve the reliability of early warning.},

	abstract = {Every year, India experiences countless landslides with devastating consequences for the affected areas. Over 12\% of the Indian landmass is prone to landslides. In India, the number of large-scale landslides and their damage seems to be increasing in recent years. Due to the lack of inaccurate prediction methods and effective early warning systems, the destruction caused by landslides is magnified. The existing system uses a lower number of factors and does not provide a method for ensuring the safety of the user. As a result, it is not effective in predicting and mitigating landslides. The proposed system allows for the mitigation of destruction to life caused by landslides, by providing them with routes to safe regions. The system receives the user's location and uses GPS to find the route to the safe zone. The model incorporates more landslide factors to ensure more accuracy in the prediction of landslides. As a result, the proposed model is more effective in the prediction and mitigation of landslides and the destruction it causes to human life.},

	abstract = {This paper submits a report on the effective adoption of machine learning algorithms for enhancing the reliability of rainfall-induced landslides. The challenges involved in the design of reliable landslide early warning systems (LEWS) and the datadriven context for overcoming these challenges have been presented. The operation of LEWS is explained using the chain of five major components (i) Data collection, (ii) Data transmission, (iii) Modelling, analysis and forecasting, (iv) Warning, and (v) Response. Failure of any of these major components of the LEWS will break the chain of operation of LEWS and the ensued consequences of each component failure are reviewed. Inferences drawn from the analysis of the reliability measures incorporated in 12 LEWS deployments across a dozen locations around the world are also presented. Based on the investigations from 12 LEWS and the real-world experience, we identified that an alternate solution is required for ensuring the reliability of LEWS, especially during disaster scenarios when warnings are crucial, but data availability is a constraint. We recognized that machine learning algorithms can provide an alternate solution and in this paper, we have discussed two machine learning approaches nowcasting and forecasting for enhancing the reliability. Both the algorithms employ historic data of the landslide monitoring parameters to learn the changes materializing in slope leading to landslide incidences. The learned knowledge is used to nowcast and forecast the real-time and future conditions of the slope from the real-time landslide monitoring parameters. In terms of ensuring reliability, (i) Nowcasting algorithm provides an alternate solution if either the Data collection component or Data transmission component of a LEWS fails. (ii) Forecasting algorithm provides extra lead-time for early warning and solves the problem of less lead-time during early warning process. The breakthrough is even when the realtime landslide monitoring parameters are not available for various reasons, these algorithms take the minimal input of rainfall forecast information for nowcasting and forecasting thus restoring the broken chain of operation of LEWS.},

	abstract = {Early alarm systems can activate vital precautions for saving lives and the economy threatened by natural hazards and human activities. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) products generate valuable ground motion data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Integrating the InSAR products and forecasting models make possible to set up early alarm systems to monitor vulnerable areas. This study proposes a technical support to early warning detection tools of ground instabilities using machine learning and InSAR time series that is capable of forecasting regions affected by potential collapses. A long short-term memory (LSTM) model is tailored to predict ground movements in three forecast ranges (i.e., SAR observations): 3, 4, and 5 multistep. A contribution of the proposed strategy is utilizing adjacent time series to decrease the possibility of falsely detecting safe regions as significant movements. The proposed tool offers ground motion-based outcomes that can be interpreted and utilized by experts to activate early alarms to reduce the consequences of possible failures in vulnerable infrastructures, such as mining areas. Three case studies in Spain, Brazil, and Australia, where fatal incidents happened, are analyzed by the proposed early alert detector to illustrate the impact of chosen temporal and spatial ranges. Since most early alarm systems are site dependent, we propose a general tool to be interpreted by experts for activating reliable alarms. The results show that the proposed tool can identify potential regions before collapse in all case studies. In addition, the tool can suggest an optimum selection of InSAR temporal (i.e., number of images) and spatial (i.e., adjacent measurement points) combinations based on the available SAR images and the characteristics of the study area.},

We processed LiCSAR interferograms using the SBAS tool, and we obtained average displacement maps for the period 2016–2021. We found that the maximum displacement rate of each landslide is located at about the center of it. The average E-W velocity of the Krini landslide is {\textasciitilde}3 cm/year (toward the east) and 0.6 cm/year downward. The line-of-sight (LOS) velocity of the landslide (descending orbit) compares well to a co-located GNSS station within (±) 3 mm/yr. Our results also suggest a correlation between rainfall and landslide motion. For the Krini landslide, a cross-correlation analysis of our data suggests that the mean time lag was 13.5 days between the maximum seasonal rainfall and the change in the LOS displacement rate. We also found that the amount of total seasonal rainfall controls the increase in the displacement rate, as 40–550\% changes in the displacement rate of the Krini landslide were detected, following to a seasonal maximum of rainfall values at the nearby meteorological station of Kato Vlassia. According to our results, it seems that large part of this mountainous region of Achaia suffers from slope instability that is manifested in various degrees of ground displacement greatly affecting its morphological features and inhabited areas.},

Compared to a traditional landslide detection approach, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been proven to have powerful capabilities in reducing the time consumed for selecting the appropriate features for landslides. Currently, the success of transformers in natural language processing (NLP) demonstrates the strength of selfattention in global semantic information acquisition. How to effectively integrate transformers into CNN, alleviate the limitation of the receptive ﬁeld, and improve the model generation are hot topics in remote sensing image processing based on deep learning (DL). Inspired by the vision transformer (ViT), this paper ﬁrst attempts to integrate a transformer into ResU-Net for landslide detection tasks with small datasets, aiming to enhance the network ability in modelling the global context of feature maps and drive the model to recognize landslides with a small dataset. Besides, a spatial and channel attention module was introduced into the decoder to effectually suppress the noise in the feature maps from the convolution and transformer. By selecting two landslide datasets with different geological characteristics, the feasibility of the proposed model was validated. Finally, the standard ResU-Net was chosen as the benchmark to evaluate the proposed model rationality. The results indicated that the proposed model obtained the highest mIoU and F1-score in both datasets, demonstrating that the ResU-Net with a transformer embedded can be used as a robust landslide detection method and thus realize the generation of accurate regional landslide inventory and emergency rescue.},

This paper proposes a novel machinelearning and deep-learning method to identify natural-terrain landslides using integrated geodatabases. First, landslide-related data are compiled, including topographic data, geological data and rainfall-related data. Then, three integrated geodatabases are established; namely, Recent Landslide Database (RecLD), Relict Landslide Database (RelLD) and Joint Landslide Database (JLD). After that, ﬁve machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), boosting methods and convolutional neural network (CNN), are utilized and evaluated on each database. A case study in Lantau, Hong Kong, is conducted to demonstrate the application of the proposed method. From the results of the case study, CNN achieves an identiﬁcation accuracy of 92.5\% on RecLD, and outperforms other algorithms due to its strengths in feature extraction and multi dimensional data processing. Boosting methods come second in terms of accuracy, followed by RF, LR and SVM. By using machine learning and deep learning techniques, the proposed landslide identiﬁcation method shows outstanding robustness and great potential in tackling the landslide identiﬁcation problem.},

The aim of this research was to explore a method based on machine learning to evaluate susceptibility to rotational landslides in an area near Cuenca city, Ecuador, which has a high incidence of these phenomena, mainly due to its environmental conditions, and in which, however, such studies are scarce. The implemented method consisted of an artiﬁcial neural network multilayer perceptron (ANN MLP), generated with the neuralnet R package, with which, by means of different backpropagation algorithms (RPROP+, RPROP−, SLR, SAG, and Backprop), ﬁve landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) were generated for the study area. A landslide inventory updated to 2019 and 10 conditioning factors, mainly topographical, geological, land cover, and hydrological, were considered. The results obtained, which were validated through the AUC-ROC value and statistical parameters of precision, recall, accuracy, and F-Score, showed a good degree of adjustment and an acceptable predictive capacity. The resulting maps showed that the area has mostly sectors of moderate, high, and very high susceptibility, whose landslide occurrence percentages vary between approximately 63\% and 80\%. In this research, different variants of the backpropagation algorithm were implemented to verify which one gave the best results. With the implementation of additional methodologies and correct zoning, future analyses could be developed, contributing to adequate territorial planning and better disaster risk management in the area.},

	abstract = {Upon the introduction of machine learning (ML) and its variants, in the form that we know today, to the landslide community, many studies have been carried out to explore the usefulness of ML in landslide research and to look at some classic landslide problems from an ML point of view. ML techniques, including deep learning methods, are becoming popular to model complex landslide problems and are starting to demonstrate promising predictive performance compared to conventional methods. Almost all the studies published in the literature in recent years belong to one of the following three broad categories: landslide detection and mapping, landslide spatial forecasting in the form of susceptibility mapping, and landslide temporal forecasting. In this paper, we present a brief overview of ML techniques, provide a general summary of the landslide studies conducted, in recent years, in the three above-mentioned categories, and make an attempt to critically evaluate the use of ML methods to model landslide processes. The paper also provides suggestions for future use of these powerful data-driven techniques in landslide studies.},

	abstract = {Accurate early warning systems for landslides are a reliable risk-reduction strategy that may significantly reduce fatalities and economic losses. Several machine learning methods have been examined for this purpose, underlying deep learning (DL) models’ remarkable prediction capabilities. The long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) algorithms are the sole DL model studied in the extant comparisons. However, several other DL algorithms are suitable for time series forecasting tasks. In this paper, we assess, compare, and describe seven DL methods for forecasting future landslide displacement: multi-layer perception (MLP), LSTM, GRU, 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN), 2xLSTM, bidirectional LSTM (bi-LSTM), and an architecture composed of 1D CNN and LSTM (Conv-LSTM). The investigation focuses on four landslides with different geographic locations, geological settings, time step dimensions, and measurement instruments. Two landslides are located in an artificial reservoir context, while the displacement of the other two is influenced just by rainfall. The results reveal that the MLP, GRU, and LSTM models can make reliable predictions in all four scenarios, while the ConvLSTM model outperforms the others in the Baishuihe landslide, where the landslide is highly seasonal. No evident performance differences were found for landslides inside artificial reservoirs rather than outside. Furthermore, the research shows that MLP is better adapted to forecast the highest displacement peaks, while LSTM and GRU are better suited to model lower displacement peaks. We believe the findings of this research will serve as a precious aid when implementing a DL-based landslide early warning system (LEWS).},

The urgent need for the accurate prediction of these geotechnical events is driven by two main goals: advancing our understanding of the underlying geophysical mechanisms and establishing efﬁcient evacuation protocols. Although traditional physics-based models offer in-depth insights, their reliance on numerous assumptions and parameters limits their practical usability. In our study, we constructed an experimental artiﬁcial slope and monitored it until failure, generating an in-depth displacement dataset. Leveraging this dataset, we developed and compared prediction models rooted in both statistical and machine learning paradigms. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between generic evaluation metrics and the speciﬁc needs of slope failure prediction, we introduced a bespoke performance. Our results indicate that while the statistical approach did not effectively provide early warnings, the machine learning models, when assessed with our bespoke performance metric, showed signiﬁcant promise as reliable early warning systems.

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has been extensively applied to model geohazards, yielding tremendous success. However, researchers and practitioners still face challenges in enhancing the reliability of ML models. In the present study, a systematic framework combining k-fold cross-validation (CV), metaheuristics (MHs), support vector regression (SVR), and Friedman and Nemenyi tests was proposed to improve the reliability and performance of geohazard modeling. The average normalized mean square error (NMSE) from k-fold CV sets was adopted as the fitness metric. Twenty of the most well-established MHs and the most recent MHs were adopted to tune the hyperparameters of SVR and were evaluated through nonparametric Friedman and post hoc Nemenyi tests to identify significant differences. Observations from a typical reservoir landslide were selected as a benchmark dataset, and the accuracy, robustness, computational time, and convergence speed of the MHs were compared. Significant performance differences among the twenty MHs were identified by Friedman and post hoc Nemenyi tests of the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE), and computational time, with p values lower than 0.05. The comparison of results demonstrated that the multiverse optimizer (MVO) is among the highest-performing, most stable, and computationally efficient algorithms, providing superior performance to other methods, with nearly optimum values of the correlation coefficient (R), a low MAE (23.5086 versus 23.9360), a low mean RMSE (48.6946 versus 50.1882), and a high mean KGE (0.9803 versus 0.9893) in predicting the displacement of the Shuping landslide. This paper considerably enriches the literature regarding hyperparameter optimization algorithms and the enhancement of their reliability. In addition, Friedman and post hoc Nemenyi tests have the potential for evaluating and comparing various ML-based geohazard models.},

Although much progress has been made with remote sensing technologies and their applications in China, there is no systematical summary report. Thus, we summarize Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), optical remote sensing, and laser technologies currently being used in China, and their associated platforms (space-borne, air-borne, and ground-based). Multi-temporal optical images and time series SAR are often used to detect active landslides at time scales of years and months. The latest optical images and SAR intensity images are usual adopted to map fresh landslides, especial for coseismic landslides. LiDAR technology has been widely applied to identify ancient landslides. Combining advantages and limitations of every technology, an integrated space-air-ground collaborative investigation strategy has been proposed for early identification and early warning of landslides. Additionally, a comprehensive landslide investigation integrating multidisciplinary approaches, including remote sensing, geology, and geophysical exploration, could be a further developing trend, because remote sensing technologies just provide surface information, while a complete understanding of landslides requires more than surface information – knowledge of geotechnical pa­ rameters, geological features, and field conditions is also needed.},

	abstract = {Slope deformation prediction is crucial for early warning of slope failure, which can prevent property damage and save human life. Existing predictive models focus on predicting the displacement of a single monitoring point based on time series data, without considering spatial correlations among monitoring points, which makes it difﬁcult to reveal the displacement changes in the entire monitoring system and ignores the potential threats from nonselected points. To address the above problem, this paper presents a novel deep learning method for predicting the slope deformation, by considering the spatial correlations between all points in the entire displacement monitoring system. The essential idea behind the proposed method is to predict the slope deformation based on the global information (i.e., the correlated displacements of all points in the entire monitoring system), rather than based on the local information (i.e., the displacements of a speciﬁed single point in the monitoring system). In the proposed method, (1) a weighted adjacency matrix is built to interpret the spatial correlations between all points, (2) a feature matrix is assembled to store the time-series displacements of all points, and (3) one of the state-of-the-art deep learning models, i.e., T-GCN, is developed to process the above graph-structured data consisting of two matrices. The effectiveness of the proposed method is veriﬁed by performing predictions based on a real dataset. The proposed method can be applied to predict time-dependency information in other similar geohazard scenarios, based on time-series data collected from multiple monitoring points.},

	abstract = {Landslide displacement prediction is an essential base of landslide hazard prevention, which often needs to establish an accurate prediction model. To achieve accuracy prediction of landslide displacement, a displacement prediction model based on a salp-swarm-algorithm-optimized temporal convolutional network (SSA-TCN) is proposed. The TCN model, consisting of a causal dilation convolution layer residual block, can ﬂexibly increase the receptive ﬁelds and capture the global information in a deeper layer. SSA can solve the hyperparameter problem well for TCN model. The Muyubao landslide displacement collected from a professional GPS monitoring system implemented in 2006 is used to analyze the displacement features of the slope and evaluate the performance of the SSA-TCN model. The cumulative displacement time series is decomposed into trend displacement (linear part) and periodic displacement (nonlinear part) by the variational modal decomposition (VMD) method. Then, a polynomial function is used to predict the trend displacement, and the SSA-TCN model is used to predict the periodic displacement of the landslide based on considering the response relationship between periodic displacement, rainfall, and reservoir water. This research also compares the proposed approach results with the other popular machine learning and deep learning models. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model is superior to and more effective and accurate than the others at predicting the landslide displacement.},

In this paper we present an unsupervised and automated approach based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering to detect patterns of natural or anthropogenic ground deformation from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) Time Series. For our proof-of-concept, we focus on the Valle d’Aosta region (Northwest Italy) where mass wasting processes frequently occurs, interacting with human activities and in­ frastructures. The large volumes of Sentinel-1 data produced allows for retrieving horizontal and vertical Time Series from multi-geometry data fusion of Line-of-Sight (LOS) InSAR measurements. The added benefit of combining ascending/descending InSAR data and interpolating displacements in time at different time steps is here explored prior to data dimensionality reduction and feature extraction through PCA. The retrieved principal components serve as a continuous solution for cluster membership indicators in the K-means clustering method, allowing to define spatially and temporally coherent displacement phenomena. The signal of the ground deformation clusters is then deconstructed into the underlying trend and seasonality components to enhance the interpretability of the classified satellite InSAR features. Using InSAR Time series data spanning 2014–2020, the proposed approach detects several slope movements and anthropogenic deformations with both linear and seasonal displacement behaviours. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of our transferable approach to the development of automated ground motion analysis systems.},

Time-series displacement data of slopes directly reﬂect the deformation characteristics and stability properties of slopes. The use of existing data analysis approaches, such as statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, to establish a reasonable and accurate prediction model based on the monitored time-series displacement data is a common solution to slope deformation prediction. In this paper, we conduct a comparative investigation of machine learning approaches for slope deformation prediction based on monitored time-series displacement data. First, we established eleven slope deformation prediction models based on the time-series displacement data obtained from seven in situ monitoring points of the Huanglianshu landslide using machine learning approaches. Second, four evaluation metrics were used to comparatively analyze the prediction performance of all models at each monitoring point. The experimental results of the Huanglianshu landslide indicated that the long-short-term memory (LSTM) model with an attention mechanism and the transformer model achieved the highest prediction accuracy. The comparative analysis of model characteristics suggested that the Transformer model is better adapted to predict nonlinear landslide displacements that are affected by multiple factors. The drawn conclusion could help select a suitable slope deformation model for early landslide warnings.},

Thus, a rising number of scholars are adopting machine learning techniques to settle geotechnical issues. In this paper, the application of three popular machine learning algorithms, support vector machine (SVM), artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), and decision tree (DT), as well as other representative algorithms in geotechnical engineering, is reviewed. Meanwhile, the applicability of diverse machine learning algorithms in settling speciﬁc geotechnical engineering issues is compared. The main ﬁndings are as follows: ANN, SVM, and DT have been widely adopted to solve a variety of geotechnical engineering issues, such as the classiﬁcation of soil and rock types, predicting the properties of geotechnical materials, etc. Based on the collected relevant research, the performance of random forest (RF) in sorting soil types and assessing landslide susceptibility is satisfying; SVM has high precision in classifying rock types and forecasting rock deformation; and backpropagation ANNs and Hopﬁeld ANNs are recommended to forecast rock compressive strength and soil settlement, respectively.},

	abstract = {We present a neural network-based method to detect anomalies in time-dependent surface deformation fields given a set of geodetic images of displacements collected from multiple viewing geometries. The presented methodology is based on a supervised classification approach using combinations of line of sight multitemporal, multi-geometry interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series of displacements. We demonstrate this method with a set of 170 million time series of surface deformation generated for the entire Italian territory and derived from ERS, ENVISAT, and COSMO-SkyMed Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite constellations. We create a training dataset that has been compared with independently validated data and current state-of-the-art classification techniques. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, the presented framework provides increased detection accuracy, precision, recall, and reduced processing times for critical infrastructure and landslide monitoring. This study highlights how the proposed approach can accelerate the anomalous points identification step by up to 147 times compared to analytical and other artificial intelligence methods and can be theoretically extended to other geodetic measurements such as GPS, leveling data, or extensometers. Our results indicate that the proposed approach would make the anomaly identification post-processing times negligible when compared to the InSAR time-series processing.},

The ground deformation in this paper appeared in the city’s development, although it is close to the Erhai region, which is diﬀerent from a water-deﬁcient city. Therefore, the analysis and prediction of ground deformation using a new method is required. In this study, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from 2015 to 2018 were used to study the characteristics of ground deformation in the Erhai region using the Small Baseline Subset Interferometric SAR (SBAS-InSAR) technique. The results were cross-validated using ascending and descending direction images to ensure the accuracy. In addition, the results showed that there was little ground deformation in the northern part of the Erhai region, while there was obvious ground deformation in the southern part. Four inﬂuencing factors—including the building area, water level, cumulative precipitation, and cumulative temperature of the southern Erhai region—were used together to predict the cumulative ground deformation using back-propagation (BP). The R of all the involved data was 0.966, and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the simulated values using BP and the true measured values were 3.063, 1.003, and 1.119, respectively. The results showed that BP has great potential in predicting the change tendency of ground deformation with high precision. The main reason for ground deformation is the continuous increase of building area; the water level followed. The cumulative precipitation and cumulative temperature are the reasons for the seasonal ground deformation. Some countermeasures and suggestions are given to face the challenge of serious ground deformation.},

Temporal analysis of DInSAR products, and in particular deformation Time Series (TS), enables advanced investigations for ground deformation identiﬁcation. Machine Learning algorithms offer efﬁcient tools for classifying large volumes of data. In this study, we train supervised Machine Learning models using 5000 reference samples of three datasets to classify DInSAR TS in ﬁve deformation trends: Stable, Linear, Quadratic, Bilinear, and Phase Unwrapping Error. General statistics and advanced features are also computed from TS to assess the classiﬁcation performance. The proposed methods reported accuracy values greater than 0.90, whereas the customized features signiﬁcantly increased the performance. Besides, the importance of customized features was analysed in order to identify the most effective features in TS classiﬁcation. The proposed models were also tested on 15000 unlabelled data and compared to a model-based method to validate their reliability. Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting could accurately classify reference samples and positively assign correct labels to random samples. This study indicates the efﬁciency of Machine Learning models in the classiﬁcation and management of DInSAR TSs, along with shortcomings of the proposed models in classiﬁcation of nonmoving targets (i.e., false alarm rate) and a decreasing accuracy for shorter TS.},

However, it is of primary importance to implement automated solutions aimed at performing integrated analysis of large amounts of interferometric data. To effectively detect high-displacement areas and classify ground motion sources, here we explore the feasibility of a machine learning-based approach. This is achieved by applying the random forest (RF) technique to large-scale deformation maps spanning 2015–2018. Focusing on the northern part of Italy, we train the model to identify landslide, subsidence, and mining-related ground motion with which to construct a balanced training dataset. The presence of noisy signals and other sources of deformation is also tackled within the model construction. The proposed approach relies on the use of explanatory variables extracted from the A-DInSAR datasets and from freely accessible informative layers such as Digital Elevation Model (DEM), land cover maps, and geohazard inventories. In general, the model performance is very promising as we achieved an overall accuracy of 0.97, a true positive rate of 0.94 and an F1-Score of 0.93. The obtained outcomes demonstrate that such transferable and automated approach may constitute an asset for stake­ holders in the framework of geohazards risk management.},

To this end, wide range of researches are collected in order to demonstrate the development of DM techniques, detect the most popular DM techniques, and compare the applicability of existing DM techniques in SHM. Eventually, it is concluded that the application of artificial intelligence has the highest demand rate in SHM while the most popular algorithms including artificial neural network, genetic algorithm, fuzzy logic, and principal component analysis are utilized for damage detection of civil structures.},

Solutions that are efﬁcient for speciﬁc hardware architectures can not be used in other environments. Packages that work on generic hardware and open standards will not have the same performance as dedicated solutions. Software that assumes that its users are computer programmers are ﬂexible but may be difﬁcult to learn for a wide audience. This paper describes sits, an open-source R package for satellite image time series analysis using machine learning. To allow experts to use satellite imagery to the fullest extent, sits adopts a time-ﬁrst, space-later approach. It supports the complete cycle of data analysis for land classiﬁcation. Its API provides a simple but powerful set of functions. The software works in different cloud computing environments. Satellite image time series are input to machine learning classiﬁers, and the results are post-processed using spatial smoothing. Since machine learning methods need accurate training data, sits includes methods for quality assessment of training samples. The software also provides methods for validation and accuracy measurement. The package thus comprises a production environment for big EO data analysis. We show that this approach produces high accuracy for land use and land cover maps through a case study in the Cerrado biome, one of the world’s fast moving agricultural frontiers for the year 2018.},

However, some restrictions cause this process to provide a small number of images leading to the problem of small data for SAR-based SHM. Conversely, the major challenge of the long-term monitoring of civil structures pertains to variations in their inherent properties by environmental and/or operational variability. This article aims to propose new hybrid unsupervised learning methods for addressing these challenges. The methods in this work contain three main parts: (i) data augmentation by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, (ii) feature normalization, and (iii) decision making via Mahalanobis-squared distance. The ﬁrst method presented in this work develops an artiﬁcial neural network-based feature normalization by proposing an iterative hyperparameter selection of hidden neurons of the network. The second method is a novel unsupervised teacher–student learning by combining an undercomplete deep neural network and an overcomplete single-layer neural network. A small set of long-term displacement samples extracted from a few SAR images of TerraSAR-X is applied to validate the proposed methods. The results show that the methods can effectively deal with the major challenges in the SAR-based SHM applications.},

However, interpreting large InSAR datasets can be difﬁcult due to the volume of data generated, requiring sophisticated signal-processing techniques to extract meaningful information. We propose a novel framework for interpreting the large number of ground displacement measurements derived from InSAR time series techniques using a three-step process: (1) dimensionality reduction of the displacement time series from an InSAR data stack; (2) clustering of the reduced dataset; and (3) detecting and quantifying accelerations and decelerations of deforming areas using a change detection method. The displacement rates, spatial variation, and the spatio-temporal nature of displacement accelerations and decelerations are used to investigate the physical behaviour of the deforming ground by linking the timing and location of changes in displacement rates to potential causal and triggering factors. We tested the method over the Bandung Basin in Indonesia using Sentinel-1 data processed with the small baseline subset InSAR time series technique. The results showed widespread subsidence in the central basin with rates up to 18.7 cm/yr. We identiﬁed 12 main clusters of subsidence, of which three covering a total area of 22 km2 show accelerating subsidence, four clusters over 52 km2 show a linear trend, and ﬁve show decelerating subsidence over an area of 22 km2. This approach provides an objective way to monitor and interpret ground movements, and is a valuable tool for understanding the physical behaviour of large deforming areas.},

	abstract = {As a type of earth observation technology, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is increasingly widely used in the ﬁeld of geological disaster detection. However, the application of InSAR in low-coherence areas, such as alpine canyon areas and vegetation coverage areas, is subject to considerable limitations. How to accurately identify landslides from InSAR measurement data in these areas remains the subject of several challenges and shortcomings. Based on statistical analysis and spatial cluster analysis, in this paper, we propose an automatic landslide identiﬁcation and gradation method suitable for low-coherence areas. The proposed method combines the small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) method and the interferogram stacking (stacking-InSAR) method to obtain a deformation map in the study area, using statistical analysis and spatial cluster analysis to extract deformation regions and landslide polygons to propose a landslide screening model (LSM) based on multivariate features to screen landslides and reduce the interference of noise in landslide identiﬁcation, in addition to proposing a landslide gradation model (LGM) based on signum function to grade the identiﬁed landslides and provide support to distinguish landslides with different deformation degrees. The method was applied to landslide identiﬁcation in the upper section of the Jinsha River basin, and 47 potential landslides were identiﬁed, including 15 high-risk landslides and 13 landslides endangering villages. The experimental results show that the proposed method can identify landslides accurately and hierarchically in low-coherence areas, providing support for geological hazard investigation agencies and local departments.},

	abstract = {Cascading landslides are specific multi-hazard events in which a primary movement triggers successive landslide processes. Areas with dynamic and quickly changing environments are more prone to this type of phenomena. Both the kind and the evolution velocity of a landslide depends on the materials involved. Indeed, rockfalls are generated when rocks fall from a very steep slope, while debris flow and/or mudslides are generated by fine materials like silt and clay after strong water imbibition. These events can amplify the damage caused by the initial trigger and propagate instability along a slope, often resulting in significant environmental and societal impacts. The Morino-Rendinara cascading landslide, situated in the Ernici Mountains along the border of the Abruzzo and Lazio regions (Italy), serves as a notable example of the complexities and devastating consequences associated with such events. In March 2021, a substantial debris flow event obstructed the Liri River, marking the latest step in a series of landslide events. Conventional techniques such as geomorphological observations and geological surveys may not provide exhaustive information to explain the landslide phenomena in progress. For this reason, UAV image acquisition, InSAR interferometry, and pixel offset analysis can be used to improve the knowledge of the mechanism and kinematics of landslide events. In this work, the interferometric data ranged from 3 January 2020 to 24 March 2023, while the pixel offset data covered the period from 2016 to 2022. The choice of such an extensive data window provided comprehensive insight into the investigated events, including the possibility of identifying other unrecorded events and aiding in the development of more effective mitigation strategies. Furthermore, to supplement the analysis, a specific finite element method for slope stability analysis was used to reconstruct the deep geometry of the system, emphasizing the effect of groundwater-level flow on slope stability. All of the findings indicate that major landslide activities were concentrated during the heavy rainfall season, with movements ranging from several centimeters per year. These results were consistent with numerical analyses, which showed that the potential slip surface became significantly more unstable when the water table was elevated.},

            Clustering analysis of sequence data continues to address many applications in engineering design, aided with the rapid growth of machine learning in applied science. This paper presents an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to extract defining characteristics of earthquake ground‐motion spectra, also called latent features, to aid in ground‐motion selection (GMS). In this context, a latent feature is a low‐dimensional machine‐discovered spectral characteristic learned through nonlinear relationships of a neural network autoencoder. Machine discovered latent features can be combined with traditionally defined intensity measures and clustering can be performed to select a representative subgroup from a large ground‐motion suite. The objective of efficient GMS is to choose characteristic records representative of what the structure will probabilistically experience in its lifetime. Three examples are presented to validate this approach, including the use of synthetic and field recorded ground‐motion datasets. The presented deep embedding clustering of ground‐motion spectra has three main advantages: (1) defining characteristics that represent the sparse spectral content of ground motions are discovered efficiently through training of the autoencoder, (2) domain knowledge is incorporated into the machine learning framework with conditional variables in the deep embedding scheme, and (3) the method results in a ground‐motion subgroup that is more representative of the original ground‐motion suite compared to traditional GMS techniques.},

A review on the Sustainable Development concept and its goals is presented followed by Earth Observation approaches relevant to this field, giving special attention to the contribution of Machine Learning methods and algorithms as well as their potential and capabilities to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, it is observed that Earth Observation plays a key role in monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals given its cost-effectiveness pertaining to data acquisition on all scales and information richness. Despite the success of Machine Learning upon Earth Observation data analysis, it is observed that performance is heavily dependent on the ability to extract and synthesise characteristics from data. Hence, a deeper and effective analysis of the available data is required to identify the strongest features and, hence, the key factors pertaining to Sustainable Development. Overall, this research provides a deeper understanding on the relation between Sustainable Development, Earth Observation and Machine Learning, and how these can support the Sustainable Development of countries and the means to find their correlations. In pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals, given the relevance and growing amount of data generated through Earth Observation, it is concluded that there is an increased need for new methods and techniques strongly suggesting the use of new Machine Learning techniques.},

	abstract = {Dam behaviour is difficult to predict with high accuracy. Numerical models for structural calculation solve the equations of continuum mechanics, but are subject to considerable uncertainty as to the characterisation of materials, especially with regard to the foundation. As a result, these models are often incapable to calculate dam behaviour with sufficient precision. Thus, it is difficult to determine whether a given deviation between model results and monitoring data represent a relevant anomaly or incipient failure.  
By contrast, there is a tendency towards automatising dam monitoring devices, which allows for increasing the reading frequency and results in a greater amount and variety of data available, such as displacements, leakage, or interstitial pressure, among others. 
This increasing volume of dam monitoring data makes it interesting to study the ability of advanced tools to extract useful information from observed variables.  
In particular, in the field of Machine Learning (ML), powerful algorithms have been developed to face problems where the amount of data is much larger or the underlying phenomena is much less understood.  
In this thesis, the possibilities of machine learning techniques were analysed for application to dam structural analysis based on monitoring data. The typical characteristics of the data sets available in dam safety were taking into account, as regards their nature, quality and size. 
A critical literature review was performed, from which the key issues to consider for implementation of these algorithms in dam safety were identified. A comparative study of the accuracy of a set of algorithms for predicting dam behaviour was carried out, considering radial and tangential displacements and leakage flow in a 100-m high dam. The results suggested that the algorithm called ``Boosted Regression Trees'' (BRT) is the most suitable, being more accurate in general, while flexible and relatively easy to implement.  
At a later stage, the possibilities of interpretation of the mentioned algorithm were evaluated, to identify the shape and intensity of the association between external variables and the dam response, as well as the effect of time. The tools were applied to the same test case, and allowed more accurate identification of the time effect than the traditional statistical method.  
Finally, a methodology for the implementation of predictive models based on BRT for early detection of anomalies was developed and implemented in an interactive tool that provides information on dam behaviour, through a set of selected devices. It allows the user to easily verify whether the actual data for each of these devices are within a pre-defined normal operation interval.
          El comportamiento estructural de las presas de embalse es difícil de predecir con precisión. Los modelos numéricos para el cálculo estructural resuelven las ecuaciones de la mecánica de medios continuos, pero están sujetos a una gran incertidumbre en cuanto a la caracterización de los materiales, especialmente en lo que respecta a la cimentación. Como consecuencia, frecuentemente estos modelos no son capaces de calcular el comportamiento de las presas con suficiente precisión. Así, es difícil discernir si un estado que se aleja en cierta medida de la normalidad supone o no una situación de riesgo estructural. Por el contrario, muchas de las presas en operación cuentan con un gran número de aparatos de auscultación, que registran la evolución de diversos indicadores como los movimientos, el caudal de filtración, o la presión intersticial, entre otros. Aunque hoy en día hay muchas presas con pocos datos observados, hay una tendencia clara hacia la instalación de un mayor número de aparatos que registran el comportamiento con mayor frecuencia. Como consecuencia, se tiende a disponer de un volumen creciente de datos que reflejan el comportamiento de la presa, lo cual hace interesante estudiar la capacidad de herramientas desarrolladas en otros campos para extraer información útil a partir de variables observadas. En particular, en el ámbito del Aprendizaje Automático (Machine Learning), se han desarrollado algoritmos muy potentes para entender fenómenos cuyo mecanismo es poco conocido, acerca de los cuales se dispone de grandes volúmenes de datos. En la tesis se ha hecho un análisis de las posibilidades de las técnicas más recientes de aprendizaje automático para su aplicación al análisis estructural de presas basado en los datos de auscultación. Para ello se han tenido en cuenta las características habituales de las series de datos disponibles en las presas, en cuanto a su naturaleza, calidad y cantidad. Se ha realizado una revisión crítica de la bibliografía existente, a partir de la cual se han identificado los aspectos clave a tener en cuenta para implementación de estos algoritmos en la seguridad de presas. Se ha realizado un estudio comparativo de la precisión de un conjunto de algoritmos para la predicción del comportamiento de presas considerando desplazamientos radiales, tangenciales y filtraciones. Para ello se han utilizado datos reales de una presa bóveda. Los resultados sugieren que el algoritmo denominado ``Boosted Regression Trees'' (BRTs) es el más adecuado, por ser más preciso en general, además de flexible y relativamente fácil de implementar. En una etapa posterior, se han identificado las posibilidades de interpretación del citado algoritmo para extraer la forma e intensidad de la asociación entre las variables exteriores y la respuesta de la presa, así como el efecto del tiempo. Las herramientas empleadas se han aplicado al mismo caso piloto, y han permitido identificar el efecto del tiempo con más precisión que el método estadístico tradicional. Finalmente, se ha desarrollado una metodología para la aplicación de modelos de predicción basados en BRTs en la detección de anomalías en tiempo real. Esta metodología se ha implementado en una herramienta informática interactiva que ofrece información sobre el comportamiento de la presa, a través de un conjunto de aparatos seleccionados. Permite comprobar a simple vista si los datos reales de cada uno de estos aparatos se encuentran dentro del rango de funcionamiento normal de la presa.},

	abstract = {The main aim of structural safety control is the multiple assessments of the expected dam behaviour based on models and the measurements and parameters that characterise the dam’s response and condition. In recent years, there is an increase in the use of data-based models for the analysis and interpretation of the structural behaviour of dams. Multiple Linear Regression is the conventional, widely used approach in dam engineering, although interesting results have been published based on machine learning algorithms such as artiﬁcial neural networks, support vector machines, random forest, and boosted regression trees. However, these models need to be carefully developed and properly assessed before their application in practice. This is even more relevant when an increase in users of machine learning models is expected. For this reason, this paper presents extensive work regarding the veriﬁcation and validation of data-based models for the analysis and interpretation of observed dam’s behaviour. This is presented by means of the development of several machine learning models to interpret horizontal displacements in an arch dam in operation. Several validation techniques are applied, including historical data validation, sensitivity analysis, and predictive validation. The results are discussed and conclusions are drawn regarding the practical application of data-based models.},

In this study, we explored the applicability of two diﬀerential interferometry techniques, conventional and advanced diﬀerential InSAR (A-DInSAR), for topographic mapping and long-term geotechnical monitoring by exploiting satellite data, particularly Sentinel-1 SAR data, which is publicly shared. We speciﬁcally used the open-source tools of SeNtinel Application Platform (SNAP) and Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) for interferometric data processing to implement A-DInSAR. This study presents various applications, which include generation of a digital elevation model (DEM), mapping of seismically induced displacement and associated damages, and detection and long-term monitoring of tunneling-induced ground deformation and rainfall-induced landslide. Geometric and temporal decorrelations posed challenges and limitations in the successful implementation of Sentinel-1 SAR interferometry speciﬁcally in vegetated areas.

ANN, ML, DL, and EL models have found extensive application in predicting geotechnical and geoenvironmental parameters. This research aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the applications of ANN, ML, DL, and EL in addressing forecasting within the ﬁeld related to geotechnical engineering, including soil mechanics, foundation engineering, rock mechanics, environmental geotechnics, and transportation geotechnics. Previous studies have not collectively examined all four algorithms—ANN, ML, DL, and EL—and have not explored their advantages and disadvantages in the ﬁeld of geotechnical engineering. This research aims to categorize and address this gap in the existing literature systematically. An extensive dataset of relevant research studies was gathered from the Web of Science and subjected to an analysis based on their approach, primary focus and objectives, year of publication, geographical distribution, and results. Additionally, this study included a co-occurrence keyword analysis that covered ANN, ML, DL, and EL techniques, systematic reviews, geotechnical engineering, and review articles that the data, sourced from the Scopus database through the Elsevier Journal, were then visualized using VOS Viewer for further examination. The results demonstrated that ANN is widely utilized despite the proven potential of ML, DL, and EL methods in geotechnical engineering due to the need for real-world laboratory data that civil and geotechnical engineers often encounter. However, when it comes to predicting behavior in geotechnical scenarios, EL techniques outperform all three other methods. Additionally, the techniques discussed here assist geotechnical engineering in understanding the beneﬁts and disadvantages of ANN, ML, DL, and EL within the geo techniques area. This understanding enables geotechnical practitioners to select the most suitable techniques for creating a certainty and resilient ecosystem.},

	abstract = {The advances in information and communication technologies led to a general trend towards the availability of more detailed information on dam behaviour. This allows applying advanced data-based algorithms in its analysis, which has been reﬂected in an increasing interest in the ﬁeld. However, most of the related literature is limited to the evaluation of model prediction accuracy, whereas the ulterior objective of data analysis is dam safety assessment. In this work, a machine learning algorithm (boosted regression trees) is the core of a methodology for early detection of anomalies. It also includes a criterion to determine whether certain discrepancy between predictions and observations is normal, a procedure to compute a realistic estimate of the model accuracy, and an original approach to identify extraordinary load combinations. The performance of causal and non-causal models is assessed in terms of their ability to detect different types of anomalies, which were artiﬁcially introduced on reference time series generated with a numerical model of a 100-m high arch dam. The ﬁnal approach was implemented in an on-line application to visualise the results in an intuitive way to support decision making. Copyright c 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Dam safety assessment is typically made by comparison between the outcome of some predictive model and measured monitoring data. This is done separately for each response variable, and the results are later interpreted before decision making. In this work, three approaches based on machine learning classiﬁers are evaluated for the joint analysis of a set of monitoring variables: multiclass, two-class and one-class classiﬁcation. Support vector machines are applied to all prediction tasks, and random forest is also used for multi-class and two-class. The results show high accuracy for multi-class classiﬁcation, although the approach has limitations for practical use. The performance in two-class classiﬁcation is strongly dependent on the features of the anomalies to detect and their similarity to those used for model ﬁtting. The one-class classiﬁcation model based on support vector machines showed high prediction accuracy, while avoiding the need for correctly selecting and modelling the potential anomalies. A criterion for anomaly detection based on model predictions is deﬁned, which results in a decrease in the misclassiﬁcation rate. The possibilities and limitations of all three approaches for practical use are discussed.},

Clustering time-series data has been used in diverse scientific areas to discover patterns which empower data analysts to extract valuable information from complex and massive datasets. In case of huge datasets, using supervised classification solutions is almost impossible, while clustering can solve this problem using unsupervised approaches. In this research work, the focus is on time-series data, which is one of the popular data types in clustering problems and is broadly used from gene expression data in biology to stock market analysis in finance. This review will expose four main components of time-series clustering and is aimed to represent an updated investigation on the trend of improvements in efficiency, quality and complexity of clustering time-series approaches during the last decade and enlighten new paths for future works.},

	abstract = {Geological disasters are responsible for the loss of human lives and for significant economic and financial damage every year. Considering that these disasters may occur anywhere—both in remote and/or in highly populated areas—and anytime, continuously monitoring areas known to be more prone to geohazards can help to determine preventive or alert actions to safeguard human life, property and businesses. Remote sensing technology—especially satellite-based—can be of help due to its high spatial and temporal coverage. Indeed, data acquired from the most recent satellite missions is considered suitable for a detailed reconstruction of past events but also to continuously monitor sensitive areas on the lookout for potential geohazards. This work aims to apply different techniques and methods for extensive exploitation and analysis of remote sensing data, with special emphasis given to landslide hazard, risk management and disaster prevention. Multi-temporal SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) interferometry, SAR tomography, high-resolution image matching and data modelling are used to map out landslides and other geohazards and to also monitor possible hazardous geological activity, addressing different study areas: (i) surface deformation of mountain slopes and glaciers; (ii) land surface displacement; and (iii) subsidence, landslides and ground fissure. Results from both the processing and analysis of a dataset of earth observation (EO) multi-source data support the conclusion that geohazards can be identified, studied and monitored in an effective way using new techniques applied to multi-source EO data. As future work, the aim is threefold: extend this study to sensitive areas located in different countries; monitor structures that have strategic, cultural and/or economical relevance; and resort to artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to be able to analyse the huge amount of data generated by satellite missions and extract useful information in due course.},

The advantages and limitations of satellite InSAR in monitoring pre-failure landslide behaviour are addressed in ﬁve different case histories back-analysed using data acquired by different satellite missions: Montescaglioso landslide (2013, Italy), Scillato landslide (2015, Italy), Bingham Canyon Mine landslide (2013, UT, USA), Big Sur landslide (2017, CA, USA) and Xinmo landslide (2017, China). This paper aimed at providing a contribution to improve the knowledge within the subject area of landslide forecasting using monitoring data, in particular exploring the suitability of satellite InSAR for spatial and temporal prediction of large landslides. The study conﬁrmed that satellite InSAR can be successful in the early detection of slopes prone to collapse; its limitations due to phase aliasing and low sampling frequency are also underlined. According to the results, we propose a novel landslide predictability classiﬁcation discerning ﬁve different levels of predictability by satellite InSAR. Finally, the big step forward made for landslide forecasting applications since the beginning of the ﬁrst SAR systems (ERS and Envisat) is shown, highlighting that future perspectives are encouraging thanks to the expected improvement of upcoming satellite missions that could highly increase the capability to monitor landslides’ pre-failure behaviour.},

	abstract = {In the absence of systematic structural monitoring to support adequate maintenance standards, many existing infrastructures may reach unacceptable quality levels during their life cycle, resulting in signiﬁcant damage and even potential failure. The metropolitan area of the Gulf of Salerno (Italy), served by a complex multimodal transport network connecting the port area to the roads and railways surrounding the urban area, represents an important industrial and commercial hub at the local and international scale. This particular scenario, developed in a complex morphological and geological context, has led to the interference and overlapping of the transport network (highway, railway, main and secondary roads) that run through the piedmont area north of the port. Given the relevance of the area, our research aims to highlight the capabilities of the persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) technique, belonging to the group of differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), to extract space–temporal series of displacements on ground points or artifacts with millimeter accuracy useful to understand ongoing deformation processes. By using archived data from the European Space Agency missions, i.e., ERS1/2 (European remote-sensing satellite) and ENVISAT (environmental satellite), and the most recent data from COSMO-SkyMed constellations, it was possible to collect a 28-year dataset that was used to spatially analyze displacement patterns at a site-speciﬁc scale to check the stability of viaducts and embankments, and on a larger scale to understand the activity of the surrounding slopes. Despite the different resolution and subsequently the ground density, the analysis of the different datasets showed a spatiotemporal consistency in the displacement patterns that concerned two subareas showing signiﬁcant annual velocity trends, one northeast of the city and the second in the port area. The analysis presented in this paper highlights how a complex geologic area, combining slope movements and various fault systems, could be a major concern for the stability of the overlying infrastructure and also the role that a PSI analysis can play in remotely monitoring their behavior over long periods of time.},

	abstract = {Ageing stock and extreme weather events pose a threat to the safety of infrastructure networks. In most countries, funding allocated to infrastructure management is insufﬁcient to perform systematic inspections over large transport networks. As a result, early signs of distress can develop unnoticed, potentially leading to catastrophic structural failures. Over the past 20 years, a wealth of literature has demonstrated the capability of satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) to accurately detect surface deformations of different types of assets. Thanks to the high accuracy and spatial density of measurements, and a short revisit time, space-borne remote-sensing techniques have the potential to provide a cost-effective and near real-time monitoring tool. Whilst InSAR techniques offer an effective approach for structural health monitoring, they also provide a large amount of data. For civil engineering procedures, these need to be analysed in combination with large infrastructure inventories. Over a regional scale, the manual extraction of InSAR-derived displacements from individual assets is extremely time-consuming and an automated integration of the two datasets is essential to effectively assess infrastructure systems. This paper presents a new methodology based on the fully automated integration of InSAR-based measurements and Geographic Information System-infrastructure inventories to detect potential warnings over extensive transport networks. A Sentinel dataset from 2016 to 2019 is used to analyse the Los Angeles highway and freeway network, while the Italian motorway network is evaluated by using open access ERS/Envisat datasets between 1992 and 2010, COSMO-SkyMed datasets between 2008 and 2014 and Sentinel datasets between 2014 and 2020. To demonstrate the ﬂexibility of the proposed methodology to different SAR sensors and infrastructure classes, the analysis of bridges and viaducts in the two test areas is also performed. The outcomes highlight the potential of the proposed methodology to be integrated into structural health monitoring systems and improve current procedures for transport network management.},

	abstract = {Landslides are geological disasters that can cause serious severe damage to properties and lead to the loss of human lives. The application of deep learning technology to optical remote sensing images can help in the detection of landslide areas. Traditional landslide detection models usually have complex structural designs to ensure accuracy. However, this complexity leads to slow detection, and these models often do not satisfy the rapid response required for the emergency monitoring of landslides. Therefore, we designed a lightweight landslide target detection network based on a CenterNet and a ResNet50 network. We replaced the BottleNeck in the backbone network of ResNet50 with a Ghost-BottleNeck structure to reduce the number of parameters in the model. We also introduced an attention mechanism module based on channel attention and spatial attention between the adjacent GhostModule modules to rich the landslide features. We introduced a lightweight multiscale fusion method in the decoding process that presented a cross-layer sampling operation for the encoding process based on Feature Pyramid Network. To down-sample from a low resolution to a high resolution and up-sample from a high resolution to a low resolution, thus skipping the medium-resolution levels in the path. We added the feature maps obtained in the previous step to the feature fusion. The Conv module that adjusts the number of channels in the multiscale feature fusion operation was replaced with the GhostModule to achieve lightweight capability. At the end of the network, we introduced a state-of-the-art Yolov5x as a teacher network for feature-based knowledge distillation to further improve the accuracy of our student network. We used challenging datasets including multiple targets and multiscale landslides in the western mountains of Sichuan, China (e.g., Danba, Jiuzhaigou, Wenchuan, and Maoxian) to evaluate the proposed lightweight landslide detection network. The experimental results show that our model satisﬁed landslide emergency requirements in terms of both accuracy and speed; the parameter size of the proposed lightweight model is 18.7 MB, namely, 14.6\% of the size of the original CenterNet containing the ResNet50 network. The single image detection time is 52 ms—twice as fast as the original model. The detection accuracy is 76.25\%, namely, 12\% higher than that of the original model.},

The comparison to global positioning system monitoring results indicated that the InSAR processing of the Muyubao landslide was accurate and reliable. Combined with the ﬁeld investigation, the deformation evolution and its response to triggering factors were analyzed. During this monitoring period, the creeping process of the Muyubao landslide showed obvious spatiotemporal deformation diﬀerences. The changes in the reservoir water level were the trigger of the Muyubao landslide, and its deformation mainly occurred during the ﬂuctuation period and high-water level period of the reservoir.},

	abstract = {Monitoring surface deformation on dams is commonly carried out by in situ geodetic surveying, which is time consuming and characterized by some limitations in space coverage and frequency. More recently microwave satellite-based technologies, such as advanced-DInSAR (Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry), have allowed the integration and improvement of the observation capabilities of ground-based methods thanks to their effectiveness in collecting displacement measurements on many non-destructive control points, corresponding to radar reﬂecting targets. The availability of such a large number of points of measurement, which are distributed along the whole structure and are characterized by millimetric accuracy on displacement rates, can be proﬁtably adopted for the calibration of numerical models. These models are implemented to simulate the structural behaviour of a dam under conditions of stress thus improving the ability to maintain safety standards. In this work, after having analysed how advanced DInSAR can effectively enhance the results from traditional monitoring systems that provide comparable accuracy measurements on a limited number of points, an FEM model of the Genzano di Lucania earth dam is developed and calibrated. This work is concentrated on the advanced DInSAR technique referred to as Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approach, beneﬁting from its capability to generate deformation time series at full spatial resolution and from multi-sensor SAR data, to measure the vertical consolidation displacement of the Genzano di Lucania earth dam.},

	abstract = {Monitoring structural stability in urban areas and infrastructure networks is emerging as one of the dominant socio-economic issues for population security. The problem is accentuated by the age of the infrastructure because of increasing risks due to material deterioration and loss of load capacity. In this case, SAR satellite data are crucial to identify and assess the deteriorating conditions of civil infrastructures. The large amount of data available from SAR satellite sensors leads to the exploitation and development of new GIS-based procedures for rapid responses and decision making. In recent decades, the DInSAR technique has been used efﬁciently for the monitoring of structures, providing measurement points located on structures with millimeter precision. Our study has analyzed the behavior of structures in settlements, attempting to discuss the interactions of soil and structures, and examining the behavior of different types of structures, such as roads and buildings. The method used is based on long-term SAR interferometry data and a semi-automatic procedure to measure the displacement (mm/year) of structures, through a GIS-based application performed in the “Implemented MOnitoring DIsplacement” I.MODI platform. The analysis provides extensive information on long-term spatial and temporal continuity of up to 25 years of record, using satellite SAR multi-sensors from ERS, Envisat, and COSMO-SkyMed. The interpretation uses time series spatial analysis, supported by orthophotos, and layers of the DBTR (regional topographic database), Digital Surface model (DSM), and hydrogeological map to show anomalous areas with a high displacement rate and to observe the correlation of settlements in the sediments. With the satellite information and Geographic Information System (GIS), we were able to observe relevant parameters, such as the velocity of advance in the direction of the slope (deformation proﬁles), the cumulative displacement, and the trend changes in structures. The results illustrate an innovative procedure that allows the management of DInSAR data to facilitate the effective management of structures in which a monitoring protocol was developed at different spatial scales, integrating the information into a GIS.},

	abstract = {The small Baseline Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry (SBI) technique has been widely and successfully applied in various ground deformation monitoring applications. Over the last decade, a variety of SBI algorithms have been developed based on the same fundamental concepts. Recently developed SBI toolboxes provide an open environment for researchers to apply different SBI methods for various purposes. However, there has been no thorough discussion that compares the particular characteristics of different SBI methods and their corresponding performance in ground deformation reconstruction. Thus, two SBI toolboxes that implement a total of four SBI algorithms were selected for comparison. This study discusses and summarizes the main differences, pros and cons of these four SBI implementations, which could help users to choose a suitable SBI method for their speciﬁc application. The study focuses on exploring the suitability of each SBI module under various data set conditions, including small/large number of interferograms, the presence or absence of larger time gaps, urban/vegetation ground coverage, and temporally regular/irregular ground displacement with multiple spatial scales. Within this paper we discuss the corresponding theoretical background of each SBI method. We present a performance analysis of these SBI modules based on two real data sets characterized by different environmental and surface deformation conditions. The study shows that all four SBI processors are capable of generating similar ground deformation results when the data set has sufﬁcient temporal sampling and a stable ground backscatter mechanism like urban area. Strengths and limitations of different SBI processors were analyzed based on data set conﬁguration and environmental conditions and are summarized in this paper to guide future users of SBI techniques.},

	abstract = {The determination of displacement warning thresholds is a difficult and crucial task for landslide early warning, as it requires a deep understanding of displacement monitoring curve patterns and significantly impacts the effectiveness of natural hazard mitigation efforts. In recent years, the emergence of advanced technologies such as the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar has enabled largescale monitoring of landslide surface displacement, while also introducing new challenges in establishing displacement warning thresholds. While displacement monitoring curves exhibit various patterns in large-region monitoring environments, the conventional Saito method assumes a landslide deformation trend of three creep stages and cannot achieve ideal early warning results. Consequently, this study is conducted based on an analysis of a GNSS surface displacement curve database built by the China Institute of Geological Environmental Monitoring. An identification method for identifying landslide deformation stages is developed based on the idea of morphology, leading to the creation of a big data source of landslide deformation stages. The spatial distri­ bution of these deformation stages within the data source serves as the foundation for developing a technique for identifying deformation thresholds and a corresponding multilevel early warning method. The early warning performance is validated using long-duration displacement monitoring curves, and the spatiotemporal distri­ bution characteristics of the deformation stages are discussed. This study can provides valuable insights for displacement monitoring, early warning, and hazard prevention of large-scale landslides.},

As such, this study is committed to proposing a universal phenomenological model for deformation stages division and early warning of landslides based on the kinematic features. First, five landslide deformation patterns were classified based on the creep theory, and suggestions for stage division of each deformation pattern are presented. Then, the statistical characteristics of landslide velocity were analyzed, and a probability-based deformation stage division method was proposed. Finally, the Comprehensive Standardized Deformation Index (CSDI) model, which includes the calculation of the CSDIM−M (Min-Max normalization) and CSDIM (Mean normalization) was proposed and verified in 24 landslides worldwide. The results show that, except for the oscillating pattern, the CSDIM−M is feasible in the stages division of all deformation patterns with a strong correspondence with the actual state of the landslides. The CSDIM is a reliable landslide warning criterion and threshold determination method, as it is effective in the early warning of imminent landslides with a low false alarm rate. The CSDI model provides new insight into the division of landslide deformation stages and landslide risk assessment.},

First, we use InSAR for the detection of active slope movements during the study period (October 2019 to January 2021). Then, we characterize the displacement rates and their variation through time for selected active slopes, by analysing 6-days interferograms. The evolutionary trends of the phenomena are compared to the pertaining climate and soil parameters that are used by the regional landslide early warning system (LEWS) to predict the possibility of landslide occurrence over the territory. We aim to explore the potential of differential interferometry to detect and monitor active landslides and, through that, to validate a geographical LEWS: Through the analysis of stacked interferograms, we identified 256 InSAR deformation signals (IDS) corre­ sponding to active slope movements. Their distribution is compared to the geological map and the landslide inventory, illustrating how active landslides are favoured by weak lithologies and pre-existing slope instability. Also, the relative orientation of the satellite’s line of sight with respect to the slope influences the results indi­ cating a bias in the completeness of remotely sensed data. However, in the context of land management and civil protection, the results constitute a valuable information dataset for plans managed by local authorities.},

	abstract = {The management of unstable slopes is one of the most critical issues when dealing with safety in open-pit mines. Suitable notice of impending failure events must be provided, and at the same time the number of false alarms must be kept to a minimum to avoid ﬁnancial losses deriving from unnecessary outages of the production works. Comprehensive slope monitoring programs and early warning systems are usually implemented to this aim. However, systematic procedures for their tuning are lacking and several key factors are often overlooked. Therefore the mitigation of slope failure risk is still a topic of great concern, especially in open-pit mines excavated through hard rock masses featuring markedly brittle behavior, which supposedly provide little or no measurable precursors to failure. In this paper, 9 instabilities occurred at an undisclosed open-pit mine, and monitored by ground-based radar devices, were reviewed with the goal of characterizing the typical slope deformation behavior and deﬁning the appropriate strategy for the setup of alarms. The estimated mass of the case studies ranged from 1500 t to 750,000 t. 5 instabilities culminated to failure, whereas the other 4, although showing considerable amounts and rates of movement, ultimately did not fail. The analysis provided critical insights into the deformation of hard rock masses of high geomechanical quality, and allowed the identiﬁcation of “signature” parameters of the failure events. General operative recommendations for eﬀective slope monitoring and early warning were consequently derived.},

	abstract = {Predicting the time of failure is a topic of major concern in the field of geological risk management. Several approaches, based on the analysis of displacement monitoring data, have been proposed in recent years to deal with the issue. Among these, the inverse velocity method surely demonstrated its effectiveness in anticipating the time of collapse of rock slopes displaying accelerating trends of deformation rate. However, inferring suitable linear trend lines and deducing reliable failure predictions from inverse velocity plots are processes that may be hampered by the noise present in the measurements; data smoothing is therefore a very important phase of inverse velocity analyses. In this study, different filters are tested on velocity time series from four case studies of geomechanical failure in order to improve, in retrospect, the reliability of failure predictions: Specifically, three major landslides and the collapse of an historical city wall in Italy have been examined. The effects of noise on the interpretation of inverse velocity graphs are also assessed. General guidelines to conveniently perform data smoothing, in relation to the specific characteristics of the acceleration phase, are deduced. Finally, with the aim of improving the practical use of the method and supporting the definition of emergency response plans, some standard procedures to automatically setup failure alarm levels are proposed. The thresholds which separate the alarm levels would be established without needing a long period of neither reference historical data nor calibration on past failure events.},

	abstract = {The 10-mile Slide is contained within an ancient earthflow located in British Columbia, Canada. The landslide has been moving slowly for over 40 years, requiring regular maintenance work along where a highway and a railway track cross the sliding mass. Since 2013, the landslide has shown signs of retrogression. Monitoring prisms were installed on a retaining wall immediately downslope from the railway alignment to monitor the evolution of the retrogression. As of September 2016, cumulative displacements in the horizontal direction approached 4.5 m in the central section of the railway retaining wall. After an initial phase of acceleration, horizontal velocities showed a steadier trend between 3 and 9 mm/day, which was then followed by a second acceleration phase. This paper presents an analysis of the characteristics of the surface displacement vectors measured at the monitoring prisms. Critical insight on the behavior and kinematics of the 10-mile Slide retrogression was gained. An advanced analysis of the trends of inverse velocity plots was also performed to assess the potential for a slope collapse at the 10-mile Slide and to obtain further knowledge on the nature of the sliding surface.},

Over the last decade, a variety of SBI algorithms have been developed based on the same fundamental concepts. Recently developed SBI toolboxes provide an open environment for researchers to apply different SBI methods for various purposes. However, there has been no thorough discussion that compares the particular characteristics of different SBI methods and their corresponding performance in ground deformation reconstruction. Thus, two SBI toolboxes that implement a total of four SBI algorithms were selected for comparison. This study discusses and summarizes the main differences, pros and cons of these four SBI implementations, which could help users to choose a suitable SBI method for their speciﬁc application. The study focuses on exploring the suitability of each SBI module under various data set conditions, including small/large number of interferograms, the presence or absence of larger time gaps, urban/vegetation ground coverage, and temporally regular/irregular ground displacement with multiple spatial scales. Within this paper we discuss the corresponding theoretical background of each SBI method. We present a performance analysis of these SBI modules based on two real data sets characterized by different environmental and surface deformation conditions. The study shows that all four SBI processors are capable of generating similar ground deformation results when the data set has sufﬁcient temporal sampling and a stable ground backscatter mechanism like urban area. Strengths and limitations of different SBI processors were analyzed based on data set conﬁguration and environmental conditions and are summarized in this paper to guide future users of SBI techniques.},

It claimed more than 200 lives and caused considerable environmental damage. Here we present the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS) technique on satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data to assess the course of events. We find that parts of the dam wall and tailings were experiencing deformation not consistent with consolidation settlement preceding the collapse. Furthermore, we show that the timing of the dam collapse would have been foreseeable based on this observed precursory deformation. We conclude that satellite-based monitoring techniques may help mitigate similar catastrophes in the future.},

In Pakistan, Abbottabad city in particular is experiencing fast urban growth. The main source of daily water usage for the population in these types of cities is groundwater (tube–wells). Excessive pumping and the high need for ground water for the local community are affecting the subsurface sustainability. In this study, the persistent scatterer interferometry synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR) technique with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired from the Sentinel-1 were used to monitor ground subsidence in Abbottabad City, Northern Pakistan. To estimate the ground subsidence in Abbottabad City, SARPROZ software was employed to process a series of Sentinel-1 images, acquired from March 2017 to September 2019, along both descending and ascending orbit tracks. The subsidence observed in the results shows a signiﬁcant increase from 2017 to 2019. The subsidence map shows that, during 2017, the subsidence was −30 mm/year and about −85 mm/year in 2018. While during 2019, the subsidence reached −150 mm/year. Thus, it has seen that, in the study area, the subsidence during these years increased with mean subsidence 60 mm/year. The overall trend of subsidence showed considerably high values in the center of the city, while areas away from the center of the city experienced low subsidence. Overall, the adopted methodology can be used successfully for detecting, mapping, and monitoring land surfaces vulnerable to subsidence. This will facilitate efﬁcient planning, designing of surface infrastructure, and mitigation management of subsidence-induced hazards.},

	abstract = {Ground subsidence in urban areas is a significant problem because it increases flood risk, damages buildings and infrastructure, and results in economic loss. Continual monitoring of ground deformation is important for early detection, mechanism understanding, countermeasure implementation, and deformation prediction. The Sentinel-1 satellite constellation has globally and freely provided frequent and abundant SAR data and enabled nationwide deformation monitoring through InSAR time series analysis. LiCSAR, an automatic Sentinel-1 interferometric processing system, has produced abundant interferograms with global coverage, and the products are freely accessible and downloadable through a web portal. LiCSBAS, an open source InSAR time series analysis package integrated with LiCSAR, enables users to obtain the deformation time series easily and quickly. In this study, spatially and temporally detailed deformation time series and velocities from the LiCSAR products using LiCSBAS for 73 major urban areas in Japan during 2014–2020 were derived. All LiCSBAS processing was automatically performed using predefined parameters. Many deformation signals with various temporal and spatial features, such as linear subsidence in Hirosaki, Kujyukuri, Niigata, and Kanazawa, episodic subsidence in Sanjo, annual vertical fluctuation in Hirosaki, Yamagata, Yonezawa, Ojiya, and Nogi, and linear uplift in Chofu were detected. Unknown small nonlinear uplift signals were found in Nara and Osaka in 2018. Complex postseismic deformations from the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake were also revealed. All the deformation data obtained in this study are available on an open repository and are expected to be used for further research, investigation, or interpretation. This nationwide monitoring approach using the LiCSAR products and LiCSBAS is easy to implement and applicable to other areas worldwide.},

The model estimates a maximum subsidence rate and acceleration of −5.7 cm/year and 1.1 cm/year2, respectively. The decomposition of vertical and east-west horizontal motion using the Sentinel-1 dataset indicates relatively weak partial horizontal displacement as well as substantial vertical deformation overall.

	abstract = {The construction of underground tunnels can prime or trigger ground subsidence, and thus surface deformation monitoring is required during and post-construction. Freely available satellite data allow significant possibilities for the use of remote sensing techniques, particularly multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (Mt-InSAR), for surface deformation monitoring. However, track records and field demonstrations of InSARbased tunneling-related deformation monitoring are limited, particularly in identifying the spatiotemporal evolution of ground deformation and causal factors thereof from construction activities. Therefore, this study explores the feasibility of using satellite SAR data to monitor the surface deformation associated with different tunnel construction phases. Tunneling-related surface deformation was analyzed using the persistent scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) technique and Sentinel-1B SAR data; the PS-InSAR results were compared with those from the conventional leveling method. The velocity map of the study site revealed a localized subsidence trough asso­ ciated with the construction of vertical shafts and shield tunneling. The cumulative time-series displacement map successfully tracked the spatial and temporal progression of ground deformations related to the phases of tunnel construction activities. The maximum subsidence rate in the radar line-of-sight direction was estimated to exceed 40 mm/yr, with maximum cumulative subsidence of {\textasciitilde} 200 mm. The results clearly showed that dewatering during tunneling aggravated the subsidence phenomenon. The consequent compaction and consolidation of the compressible soil layers due to the lowered groundwater table were the main causes of subsidence. Our results demonstrate the viability of the PS-InSAR technique based on the C-band Sentinel-1 product as a monitoring method to examine the spatiotemporal evolution of ground deformation patterns during tunneling activities and as a possible preliminary surveying tool to identify ongoing abnormal settlement prior to tunnel construction.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Climate change and the associated rise in air temperature have
affected the Tibetan Plateau to a significantly stronger degree than the
global average over the past decades. This has caused deglaciation,
increased precipitation and permafrost degradation. The latter in particular
is associated with increased slope instability and an increase in
mass-wasting processes, which pose a danger to infrastructure in the
vicinity. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis is well
suited to study the displacement patterns driven by permafrost processes, as
they are on the order of millimeters to decimeters. The Nyainqêntanglha
range on the Tibetan Plateau lacks high vegetation and features relatively
thin snow cover in winter, allowing for continuous monitoring of those
displacements throughout the year. The short revisit time of the Sentinel-1
constellation further reduces the risk of temporal decorrelation, making it
possible to produce surface displacement models with good spatial coverage.
We created three different surface displacement models to study heave and
subsidence in the valleys, seasonally accelerated sliding and linear creep
on the slopes. Flat regions at Nam Co are mostly stable on a multiannual
scale but some experience subsidence. We observe a clear cycle of heave and
subsidence in the valleys, where freezing of the active layer followed by
subsequent thawing cause a vertical oscillation of the ground of up to a few
centimeters, especially near streams and other water bodies. Most slopes of
the area are unstable, with velocities of 8 to 17 mm yr−1. During the
summer months surface displacement velocities more than double on most
unstable slopes due to freeze–thaw processes driven by higher temperatures
and increased precipitation. Specific landforms, most of which have been
identified as rock glaciers, protalus ramparts or frozen moraines,
reach velocities of up to 18 cm yr−1. Their movement shows little
seasonal variation but a linear pattern indicating that their displacement
is predominantly gravity-driven.},

The exact date of failure was obtained based on a photographic monitoring performed every 4 h. The long-term monitoring (2,217 days) of the rock slope carried out by a Terrestrial LiDAR allowed the early detection of both pre-failure deformation and precursory rockfalls preceding the final failure. By means of the analysis of the pre-failure deformation, four different deformed areas were detected and the tertiary creep phase was observed in three of them. An attempt to predict the time to failure was performed using the Fukuzono’s (1985) method. Furthermore, the temporal evolution of the precursory rockfalls occurred in those four areas during the progressive failure showed a close resemblance with the exponential pattern of the cumulated displacements at tertiary creep stage. Finally, the study of the meteorological conditions did not show any single triggering factor associated with the final failure. Reversely, the increase in the occurrence of precursory rockfalls on several areas of the slope together with the observed acceleration on the deformation pattern reinforce the role of a progressive degradation of the stability conditions, which ultimately leaded to the 3 December rockfall event.},

Longitudinal clustering of time series is used to reveal spatial patterns in the single epoch deformation series. Seasonal trend decomposition of the aggregated time series is performed to separate deformation trends from seasonal de­ formations. The applicability of the framework is showcased at the example of an integral concrete bridge located in the port of Vienna. Results are validated against in situ deformation measurements.
